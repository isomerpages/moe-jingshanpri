<p><strong>SCHOOL TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLAN 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We seek always to be
a Safe and Health-Promoting School, as set out in our School Operating
Principles in the Total Curriculum Framework. Our commitment to safety
and health enables an environment for the school community to Learn for
Life and Flourish as One.&nbsp; We adopt “Safety for All, Flourish as One”
as the enduring theme for school safety and security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Road safety is a key
focus of school safety and is everyone’s responsibility. The school educates,
advises and reminds students regularly on good road safety practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our students travel
to and from school in a variety of ways. They travel (i) by school bus,
(ii) by private transport, (iii) by public transport (e.g. bus and MRT)
and (iv) on foot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To promote safety of
all students, teachers and stakeholders as road users, the school shares
the movement routes and gate operating hours via various platforms (e.g.
notifications to parents), so as to ensure the effective and safe management
of vehicular and personnel movement.</p>

</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commuters can gain
access into the school premises via the following ways:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main Gate – Motivation Gate (Main Entrance at Security
Post)</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Side Gate – Appreciation Gate (Leading to School
Canteen)</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back Gate – Creativity Gate (Beside School
Field and MK@JS)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Main Gate serves
both vehicles and pedestrians while the Side Gate and Back Gate are for
pedestrians only.</p>

<p><strong>Routes for Vehicles</strong>
</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u>
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the young age
of our students, parents/guardians must exercise close attention and vigilance
when driving outside the school and into the school compound. Parents/Guardians
are to adhere to the speed limit and demonstrate situational alertness
when operating their vehicle on school grounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When arriving by private
transport, students should be ready with their school bags before alighting
and should alight quickly and independently once the vehicle has come to
a stop. Parents are advised not to alight from the vehicle when dropping
off their child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 5 possible
vehicular drop-off points around the school.</p>

<p><strong>Safe Routes for Pedestrians</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staff and students who walk to school
can enter the school compound or exit from the school compound using one
of the pedestrian gates at the front, side or back of the school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staff and students are <u>not</u> to walk
onto the roads which are meant only for vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Wet Weather Plan</u>: During inclement
weather, students are to exit from the school using Side Gate (Appreciation
Gate) or Back Gate (Creativity Gate) and walk along the sheltered linkway
to their destination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As pedestrians, students are reminded
to adhere to the following:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remain vigilant at all times.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always use a designated crossing
such as traffic lights and zebra crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practise the kerb drill.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the traffic junction, cross the
road only when the green man is shown. Do not cross the road when the green
man is blinking.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always walk on the pavement and
footpath. Do not walk on the road.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not play by the side of the road.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not be distracted when walking
and/or crossing the road (e.g. do not use mobile phone and do not read)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise their hand when crossing the
road to signal to the driver.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remind other students to observe
traffic rules and practise good road safety habits.</p>
