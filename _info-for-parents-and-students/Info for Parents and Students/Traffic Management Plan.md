<h1><strong>School Traffic Management Plan 2024</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We seek always to be
a Safe and Health-Promoting School, as set out in our School Operating
Principles in the Total Curriculum Framework. Our commitment to safety
and health enables an environment for the school community to Learn for
Life and Flourish as One.&nbsp; We adopt “Safety for All, Flourish as One”
as the enduring theme for school safety and security.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Road safety is a key
focus of school safety and is everyone’s responsibility. The school educates,
advises and reminds students regularly on good road safety practices.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our students travel
to and from school in a variety of ways. They travel (i) by school bus,
(ii) by private transport, (iii) by public transport (e.g. bus and MRT)
and (iv) on foot.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To promote safety of
all students, teachers and stakeholders as road users, the school shares
the movement routes and gate operating hours via various platforms (e.g.
notifications to parents), so as to ensure the effective and safe management
of vehicular and personnel movement.</p>
<h2><strong>Operating Hours of Gates</strong></h2>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commuters can gain
access into the school premises via the following ways:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main Gate – Motivation Gate (Main Entrance at Security
Post)</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Side Gate – Appreciation Gate (Leading to School
Canteen)</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back Gate – Creativity Gate (Beside School Field
and MK@JS)</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Main Gate serves
both vehicles and pedestrians while the Side Gate and Back Gate are for
pedestrians only.</p>

<h2><strong>Routes for Vehicles</strong></h2>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the young age
of our students, parents/guardians must exercise close attention and vigilance
when driving outside the school and into the school compound. Parents/Guardians
are to adhere to the speed limit and demonstrate situational alertness
when operating their vehicle on school grounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When arriving by private
transport, students should be ready with their school bags before alighting
and should alight quickly and independently once the vehicle has come to
a stop. Parents are advised not to alight from the vehicle when dropping
off their child.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 5 possible
vehicular drop-off points around the school.</p>
