# **2022 Homework Policy**

**Jing Shan Primary School**  
**2022 Homework Policy**

**Value of Homework**

1.        Purposeful homework can enhance the achievement of learning outcomes. It reinforces students’ understanding, contributes to their learning progress and cultivates a healthy disposition towards learning.

**Definition of Homework**

2.        Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required to complete outside of curriculum time.   
Homework could be in the form of an assignment to reinforce learning concepts; a project that shows application of learning; or an interactive online platform for self-directed learning. Homework does not refer to revision of school  work or studying for spelling, tests and examinations.

**Role of Parents**

3.        Parents play an important part in the children’s education. Parents can consider doing the following to support their children in their learning.

* Check your child’s Student Handbook daily to view the homework assignments for the day.
*  Spend time to supervise your child in doing the homework assignments and learning through the homework assignments.
* Remind your child to complete the school homework before doing tuition work (if any).
* Do not do the work for your child, if you want your child to learn.
* Guide your child to set aside a regular study time and establish good study habits.
* Ensure your child’s timely completion and punctual submission of homework assignments all the time, so that there will not be a backlog.
* Consult teachers on your child’s progress.

**Role of Students**

4.       In order to benefit maximally from homework, students should do the following on a daily basis.

* Refer to the whiteboard in the classroom for the homework assignments.
* Record the homework assignments in the Student Handbook.
* Make sure that they understand what needs to be done for all the given homework assignments.
* Seek help from classmates, friends or teachers if they face any difficulty.
* Organize their textbooks, workbooks, worksheets and files systematically.
* Ensure that the homework assignments are brought home to be completed and not left in school.
* Have a home study timetable and a neat study area at home.  
* Submit completed homework assignments punctually to teachers.

**Guidelines on Homework Assignment during School Term**

5.        On a daily basis, the school endeavours to balance the value of homework with the time students may need to spend on completing homework outside curriculum hours, as follows:
