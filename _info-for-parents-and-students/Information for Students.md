<p><strong>Use of Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school policy on students' use of personal mobile devices (such as
handphones and smart watches) is as follows. Please help us to guide and
remind your child to comply with the rules.</p>
<p>1) Students can bring a handphone / smart watch to school, after parents
inform the school formally.</p>
<p>2) Students who bring a handphone / smart watch to school are to be fully
responsible for the safety and security of the handphone / smart watch.</p>
<p>3) Throughout the school day, students are to switch off the handphone
/ smart watch, unless otherwise instructed by teachers and school staff.</p>
<p>4) Students can only use the handphone / smart watch after all activities
have ended for the school day for the purpose of contacting their parents
and family. They can do so only in the foyer.</p>
<p>5) Students found using their handphones / smart watches during any learning
activity (e.g. recess, classroom lesson, CCA session and academic support/enrichment
lesson) without permission may have their handphones / smart watches confiscated
as a disciplinary measure or for the purpose of investigation. The school
will return the handphone / smart watch directly to the parents.</p>
<p><strong>Exams</strong>
</p>
<p>Orderliness and silence must be observed in the examination room.</p>
<p>Students should ensure that mobile devices are not brought into the&nbsp;examination
hall or classrooms. They have to surrender them before&nbsp;entering the
examination venues. The mobile devices will only be&nbsp;returned after
all the examinations have ended for the day.</p>
<p>Cheating is a major and serious offence. Disciplinary action will be&nbsp;taken
against candidates found cheating, attempting to cheat or&nbsp;helping
others to cheat in an examination.</p>
<h3>Thermometers</h3>
