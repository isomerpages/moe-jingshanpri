If any child wants&nbsp;to return to school earlier than the given date in the MC,&nbsp;he or she&nbsp;needs to see the doctor to get clearance to return to school.</p><p>We do not and cannot allow any child to return to school when he or she is still on medical leave as instructed by the doctors. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
