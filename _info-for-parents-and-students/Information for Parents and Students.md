#### Health Related Matters

  

Dear parents and pupils,

This is an important reminder that we need to abide by the Medical Certificates that&nbsp;are&nbsp;issued by the doctors. If any child wants&nbsp;to return to school earlier than the given date in the MC,&nbsp;he or she&nbsp;needs to see the doctor to get clearance to return to school.

We do not and cannot allow any child to return to school when he or she is still on medical leave as instructed by the doctors. Thank you for your cooperation.
