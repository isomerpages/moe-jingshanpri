# **Our Learning Environment**

**Every space a learning space**

MOE Kindergarten (MK)'s learning environment is designed with the child in mind.

Our creative use of available space encourages children to discover and explore their surroundings.

Safe outdoor spaces promote learning, engagement and active play while inviting and thoughtfully-designed classrooms support teaching and learning.
