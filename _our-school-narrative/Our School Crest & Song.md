# **Our School Song**

                                                            
### School Song 

\[Verse 1]

We learn to tell what's right from wrong   
Building bonds with everyone  
We'll be united as one  
As we strive for excellence in all we do  


\[Chorus\]

Onward we strive  
With one heart, one mind, one soul  
For Jing Shan Primary School  
With one heart, one mind, one soul   
For Jing Shan Primary School  


\[Verse 2]

We learn to think creatively   
Holding fast to integrity   
We'll live together as one   
As we strive for excellence in all we do
