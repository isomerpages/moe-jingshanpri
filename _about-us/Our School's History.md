<h1><strong>Jing Shan's History</strong></h1>
<h3>THE BEGINNING</h3>
<p>The story of Jing Shan Primary School began in 1945, when it was established
as a Chinese-medium school in Cheng Sua Lai. It was founded by local Chinese
businessmen and members of the rural community here to provide education
to children living in this area. Named Cheng San School at ﬁrst, it was
later called Chin San School, which means “Tranquil Hill” instead of the
original “Green Hill”. The school was located at the present-day Serangoon
Gardens Estate before moving to 502 Cheng San Road when the land was acquired
in the 1950s to develop the estate.</p>

<p>The students were mostly from farming families who lived in the kampung
and they communicated mostly in Chinese dialects.&nbsp; Many of them had
to walk for half an hour or more to reach the school. Facilities were basic
then and half of the walls were constructed with bricks while the other
half was built from zinc plates. As the building was small, the school
was divided into two sessions. The same levels were split so that students
could choose to attend their classes either in the morning or afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Kampong Spirit</h3>
<h5>1965 to 1974</h5>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:293px;height:190px;margin-left:15px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/third_decade.jpg">
</div>
<p>Chin San School had been re-located to the present Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3.
Prior to urbanization, before the setting up of Ang Mo Kio New Town, a
huge rubber plantation occupied this area. Many rubber tappers and labourers
supplemented their livelihood with pig and poultry farming or vegetable
gardening.</p>
<p>Though life in the&nbsp;<em>kampong</em>&nbsp;(Malay for “village”) was
not as comfortable as life in the city today, those who had been through
the kampong era would agree that they enjoyed growing up in the kampong.
Life might have been difficult, but the spirit of the community was strong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Singapore gained independence in 1965, the key problem which the
government faced was the high unemployment rate. In order to solve this
problem, the country had to move towards rapid industrialization. Multi-national
corporations were invited to set up factories in Singapore. Singaporeans
were encouraged to pick up new skills to ensure sustainable growth and
development for the country. There was also an emphasis on the learning
and speaking of the English language to facilitate good communication with
the outside world and also within multi-racial Singapore itself.</p>
<p>Over time, more and more Chinese families enrolled their children in English-medium
schools. This was to give the children an edge when they progressed to
higher education or when they entered the workforce.</p>
<h3>Growth of Ang Mo Kio New Town, Our Home</h3>
<h5>1975 to 1984</h5>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/fourth_decade_1.jpg">
</div>
<p>Development of the present Ang Mo Kio New Town began in 1973, and it was
the seventh new town to be built in Singapore. In the 1970s, many new flats
sprung up in this new town. The development of Ang Mo Kio New Town led
to higher population density in the area. Many schools in Ang Mo Kio functioned
at full capacity, and Jing Shan Primary School was one of them.</p>
<p>Two important educational policies in this decade made their impact on
Jing Shan Primary School. In 1979, Singapore’s education system adopted
the bilingual policy. Every child in Singapore would have to learn English
as the First Language and Mother Tongue as the Second Language.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>In 1982, the school was handed over to the government as the school board
did not have sufficient resources to upgrade the school to meet the standard
Primary School criteria set by the government. It was during this period
that Chin San School became a full government school. With the handing
over of the school, the dialect name “Chin San School” was dropped. The
hanyu pinyin version based on the Chinese name of the school was used and
“Jing Shan Primary School” (静山小学) became the official name of the school
in 1982.</p>
<h3>Good, Better, Best</h3>
<h5>1985 to 1994</h5>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:350px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/fifth_decade.jpg">
</div>
<p>A series of well-planned educational changes were introduced to all Singapore
schools from 1985-1991, to reduce wastage, increase flexibility within
the school system, give greater autonomy to schools, and provide greater
access to higher education.</p>
<p>During this period, many national campaigns were initiated to promote
values and encourage productivity among Singaporeans. The key messages
and values in these campaigns were cascaded and reinforced through schools.</p>
<p>Pupils in Jing Shan Primary School often participated in activities led
by the mascots Teamy the Bee (1982 – 1999), Singa the Lion, and Sharity
the Elephant. The values that these mascots represented were infused into
the school total curriculum and contextualised to cater to pupils’ learning.
The emphasis was to equip pupils with a spirit of innovation and productivity,
to have a strong anchor on moral values, and to practise graciousness by
contributing to society.</p>
<h3>Pushing the Boundaries</h3>
<h5>1995 to 2004</h5>
<p>In 1997, the Singapore education system started to move in the direction&nbsp;of
an ability-driven system with inspiration from then Prime Minister&nbsp;Goh
Chok Tong’s vision of "Thinking Schools, Learning Nation" (TSLN).</p>
<p>This vision described a nation of thinking and committed citizens&nbsp;capable
of meeting the challenges of the future, and an education&nbsp;system geared
to the needs of the 21st century.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education launched a major programme, “Programme for&nbsp;Rebuilding
and IMproving Existing schools” (PRIME) in 1999 to ensure&nbsp;that all
schools have a conducive physical environment to enhance teaching and learning.
Under the programme, schools were fitted with&nbsp;state-of-the-art facilities,
which included computer laboratories, media&nbsp;resource libraries and
Information Technology (IT) learning resource rooms.</p>
<p>As Jing Shan Primary School was built prior to 1997, the old building&nbsp;was
torn down and the current building was erected at 5 Ang Mo Kio&nbsp;Street
52. Due to the extent of the construction, Jing Shan Primary&nbsp;School
moved to a holding school (the present Da Qiao Primary School)&nbsp;while
waiting for construction to be completed. In December 2001, Jing&nbsp;Shan
Primary School finally moved back to its current premises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new building was officially opened by the late Dr Balaji Sadasivan,&nbsp;then
Minister of State for Health and Transport and MP for Ang Mo Kio&nbsp;GRC,
on 11 July 2003. The school held an official opening ceremony to mark the
special occasion.</p>
<h3>Onward We Strive</h3>
<h5>2005 to 2015</h5>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/seventh_decade.jpg">
</div>
<p>In 2005, Jing Shan celebrated her 60th Anniversary. The theme for the
ceremony was “Peaks of Excellence”, as aligned with the Ministry of Education’s
(MOE) vision of “Thinking Schools, Learning Nation”. As part of the celebration,
pupils and teachers from the Pottery Club CCA designed and crafted pottery
pieces in line with the theme. Since the “Peaks of Excellence” series,
the pupils’ pottery pieces have been highly sought by organisations including
the Ministry of Education to be used as tokens to be presented to guests
at events.</p>
<p>Seeing the opportunity to leverage on the school’s strength in pottery,
the school developed a six-year spiral programme that developed literacy
in visual arts and pottery skills, equipped pupils with critical and creative
thinking skills, and built pupils’ social and emotional competencies through
values-in-action. As a result of these efforts, the school was awarded
the niche status for Visual Arts and Pottery in 2013.</p>
<p>The year 2013 also saw Jing Shan Primary School in the limelight for its
pupils’ stellar performance at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).
The school's performance was its best in nine years. It was a fitting nod
of recognition to the quality education that the school provides.</p>
<p>The revamped mission and vision statements of the school in 2014 serve
to reinforce Jing Shan Primary School’s continuing commitment to our unique
brand of providing values-driven, holistic education that has sustained
us over seven decades.</p>
<p>With the love, care, support and dedication of our staff and the commitment
and perseverance of our pupils, Jing Shan Primary School will scale even
greater heights in future.</p>

<h3>The Roots</h3>

<p>Da Qiao Primary School was officially opened on 11 January 1936 at North
Bridge Road. It was a Chinese-medium public school that served the education
needs of the community and provided education opportunities for children
from the low income families. It was known as Tai Keou School (公立大侨学校)
then. ‘大’ refers to ‘Dabu’, the province where the founder came from, and
‘侨’ refers to the Chinese immigrants in Singapore at that time. The founder
Mr. Qiu Lin Rong (丘林容先生) also served as the Principal of the school at
that time. &nbsp; To better support the functioning of the school, members
of the Char Yong (Dabu) Association came aboard to serve as the school’s
Board of Directors in 1939. Mr. Yuan Ping (袁萍先生) was appointed the new
Principal of the school after Mr Qiu Lin Rong (丘林容先生) left. In the same
year, the school shifted to Lim Tua Tow Road at Hougang (后港五条石). In 1940,
Mr. Liu Jun Jie (刘俊皆先生) took over the Principalship of Da Qiao Primary
School. &nbsp; The school was closed down during the Japanese Occupation.
After the Japanese Occupation, Mr Liu Jun Jie re-opened the school at Lorong
Tai Seng (大成巷) in 1947. It re-located to Jalan Paya in 1964 and functioned
there until the end of 1980.</p>

<h3>The Dawn of a New Beginning</h3>
<p>In 1981, Da Qiao Primary School was established as a government school
in the residential estate of Ang Mo Kio. The school name ‘Da Qiao’, a Hanyu
Pinyin version of Tai Keou, was chosen to perpetuate the name of the former
Tai Keou School and to recognize the past contributions made to the school
by members of the Char Yong (Dabu) Association. &nbsp; The new school started
operating in its new building at 10 Ang Mo Kio St 54 in January 1982 with
38 classes and a pupil enrolment of about 1200. The school was officially
declared open by Mr Hwang Soo Jin, Deputy Speaker and Member of Parliament
for Jalan Kayu on 22 July 1983. The first Principal was Mr Cheong Cheng
Swee and the Vice Principal was Mr Ng Hing. Mr Cheong was succeeded by
Mrs Christina Koh in 1985 and later, by Mr Lee Lam Hua in 1995. &nbsp;
As a result of PRIME, a Ministry of Education school rebuilding programme,
Da Qiao Primary moved to its current campus at 8 Ang Mo Kio St 54 on 8
December 1999.</p>

<p>The new millennium marked another milestone in the history of the school
when it merged with Chong Boon Primary on 1 Jan 2000 to form the present
Da Qiao Primary. On 2 February 2002, the school celebrated its 21st Anniversary
and the Official Opening of its new campus which was declared open by Mr
Wee Siew Kim, Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio GRC. The new merged school
was headed by Mrs Loh Meng Har from 2000 to 2006.&nbsp; Mrs Bilveer Singh
took over the helm as Principal from 2007 to 2013. &nbsp; Since its merger,
the school has consciously focused its efforts in providing a holistic
education for all its students by engaging them in various programmes and
activities which mould their character, develop their academic potential,
nurture their aesthetics and sports talents, groom them as leaders, equip
them with lifeskills and instill in them a passion for learning. Today,
the school offers a variety of CCAs in sports and games, performing and
visual arts, clubs and societies. Students also performed consistently
well in the PSLE with results above National Average for most academic
subjects. &nbsp; Mrs Joyce Ang, the current Principal, leads a team of
highly dedicated teachers and administrative staff in delivering a quality
student-centric, values-driven education in line with the school philosophy
of ‘Everyone can flourish’. To date, Da Qiao has forged strong partnership
with Char Yong (Dabu) Association. The association has made important contributions
to the educational and wellbeing of the students. It was with the aim of
nurturing and developing the young that the Association started two schools,
one of which was Da Qiao. Annually, the Association awards the bursaries
and scholarships to our students to affirm their good effort. The Association
believed in bringing learning beyond the walls of the classroom. In 2017,
the Association partially funded our students for their Trips for International
Experience (TIE) Fund, to Dabu and Xiamen, China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this visit, the students visited the schools in Dabu. They visited
Hongdu Elementary School and Dabu County Zhangyunzai Experimental Primary
School. The students also had the opportunities to visit the Lee Kuan Yew
Memorial Hall where they learnt more things about Singapore’s first Prime
Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Through this trip, our students are able to
broader their horizons and expands their learning experiences that transcends
beyond the shores of Singapore. Over the years, Char Yong Dabu Association
has played a significant role in partnering Da Qiao. Together in close
partnership, we shape our students education.</p>
