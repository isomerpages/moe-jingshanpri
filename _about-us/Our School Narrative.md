<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jing Shan Primary School is the merger of the former Da Qiao Primary School
and the former Jing Shan Primary School in 2019. As a merged school, Jing
Shan Primary School forges a new identity which is anchored by history
and values and powered by strengths and future orientation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 2020, we established our Total Curriculum Framework which provides direction
and guides our work in education to provide a meaningful school experience
for our students.</p>

<h4>The Painting Analogy</h4>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At Jing Shan Primary School, we see our students as painters of their own
canvas. With every choice of colours and stroke of the brush, they paint
their aspirations, pathways and futures. The work of the school and teachers
is to equip the painters with the basic kit of know-how, techniques, attitudes
and&nbsp;materials; the space to try, experiment, imagine and create; and
the stewards to guide, challenge and support the painters. This analogy
of painters and&nbsp;painting serves as the backdrop of the school’s Total
Curriculum Framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4>School Motto, School Operating Principles and JS BRIGHT Values</h4>
<p></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We hold as constants our&nbsp;School Motto, our&nbsp;School Operating Principles&nbsp;and
our&nbsp;JS BRIGHT Values. These together provide consistency, stability
and safety&nbsp;for our painters.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The School Motto “United and True, Onward
We Strive” gives students, teachers and staff a guiding principle as a
team. The school community stands as one, remains true to its purpose and
moves forward and becomes stronger together. Significantly, “United and
True” was the school motto of the former Da Qiao Primary School and “Onward
We Strive” was the school motto of the former Jing Shan Primary School.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The School Operating Principles stand
for our day-to-day endeavour to ensure hospitable conditions and provide
a supportive environment for learning and growth. The School Operating
Principles are to foster a positive school tone of care, respect and discipline;
be a&nbsp;safe and health-promoting school.; and provide a vibrant and
stimulating environment for learning and growth.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The JS BRIGHT Values of Bravery, Responsibility,
Integrity, Inventiveness, Gratitude, Humility and Tenacity guide our students
and shape their&nbsp;positive behaviours. Each BRIGHT Value has a guiding
statement that provides a vivid description of the positive behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>School Vision, JS Learning Dispositions and JS Student Outcomes</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The School Vision is our big goal of developing our painters as Thriving
Explorers and Mindful Leaders who shape their canvases into masterpieces.
Our Thriving Explorers and Mindful Leaders possess the JS Learning Dispositions&nbsp;of
Motivation, Appreciation, Resilience and Creativity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The JS Learning Dispositions unpack the School Vision into the JS Student
Outcomes which espouse that our Thriving Explorers and Mindful Leaders
are future-ready as they develop as:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motivated learners with a growth mindset;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appreciative persons who act in service
of self and others;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resilient individuals who persevere to
overcome challenges; and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creative thinkers who adapt to new situations
and solve problems collaboratively.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>JS Curriculum Experience</h4>
<p></p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The JS Curriculum Experience is the means to realizing the School Vision
and nurture the Learning Dispositions. We adopt a <u>Strengths-Based Approach to Curriculum Design</u> of
Subject Learning and Student Development Experiences. The strengths-based
approach aims to provide a customized curriculum to meet the needs of learners,
achieved through thoughtful pedagogy which is effective and engaging, and
supported by balanced assessment which seeks always to provide feedback
for further learning and improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The JS Curriculum Experience is powered by four <u>Strategic Areas of Focus</u> which
are to Develop Critical and Inventive Thinkers; Ensure Student Well-Being;
Embrace All Learners; and Leverage People and Partnerships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition to developing a curriculum experience that is coherent and
progressive over six years, we ensure that every year of learning and development
for the child constitutes a suite of undertakings that are age and developmentally
appropriate. We see every student going through the School-Within-School
Model constituting three stages of development, with each stage having
a learning focus.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Lower School (Primary 1 and 2)</u> –
Grow and Be Present</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Middle School (Primary 3 and 4)</u> –
Strive and Be Centred</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Upper School (Primary 5 and 6)</u> –
Flourish and Be Grateful</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the directions
provided through the Strategic Areas of Focus and the developmentally appropriate
experiences through the School-Within-School Model, our students are enabled
to advance and grow holistically and steadily over six years in their Learning
Dispositions and take steps towards realizing the School Vision and becoming
Thriving Explorers and Mindful Leaders.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><u>School Culture</u></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We immerse our students
in a <u>School Culture</u> that is propelled by learning (Learn for Life)
and supported by well-being (Flourish as One). The learning, growth, engagement,
meaning-making and accomplishment occur amid positive emotions, positive
relationships, inclusion and affiliation.</p>
