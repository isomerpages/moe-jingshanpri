<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The JS Curriculum Experience seeks to develop our students as Future-Ready
Learners who are Thriving Explorers, Mindful Leaders (School Vision) with
the JS Learning Dispositions of Motivation, Appreciation, Resilience and
Creativity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The JS Curriculum Experience comprises Subject Learning and Student Development
Experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Subject Learning is for the following 8 subjects:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; English Language</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother Tongue Languages</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathematics</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science (which begins formally at P3)</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical Education</p>
<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Art</p>
<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Music</p>
<p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social Studies</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The suite of Student Development Experiences is as follows:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALP (Applied Learning Programme) “Green
Explorers @ JS”</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCA (Co-Curricular Activities) and PAL
(Programme for Active Learning)</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCE (MTL) which CCE stands for Character
and Citizenship Education and MTL refers to Mother Tongue Language</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCE (FTGP) where FTGP stands for Form
Teacher Guidance Period</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design Education</p>
<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ECG (Education and Career Guidance) including
TIDE (Thriving Interest Driven Exploration)</p>
<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internationalisation Activities</p>
<p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Level Signature Events</p>
<p>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LLP (Learning for Life Programme) “Flourish
@ JS: Character Strengths, Mindfulness and Gratitude in Action”</p>
<p>10)&nbsp;&nbsp; NE (National Education) Commemorative Days</p>
<p>11)&nbsp;&nbsp; Outdoor Adventure Learning Cohort Camps</p>
<p>12)&nbsp;&nbsp; Safety Education</p>
<p>13)&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education</p>
<p>14)&nbsp;&nbsp; Student Leadership Development</p>
<p>15)&nbsp;&nbsp; VIA (Values in Action) including Everyday Responsibilities</p>
<p>16)&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonders of Wellbeing (including Mental Wellbeing and Cyber
Wellness)</p>
<p>17)&nbsp;&nbsp; Student Handbook – Individual Activity and Personal Reflection</p>
<p>18)&nbsp;&nbsp; Family Education (Positive Parenting Plan)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We adopt a Strengths-Based Approach to Curriculum Design and a whole-school
approach to dispositional development, as part of nurturing future-ready
learners. This focus on developing dispositions, which are defined as character
and performance strengths important for lifelong learning and total wellbeing,
intentionally moves the school away from an over-emphasis on examinations
and broadens the definition of success beyond marks and grades.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every Subject develops
subject-specific Performance Strengths in our students, where Performance
Strengths are dispositions, attitudes, processes and competencies.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, every Student
Development Experience develops programme-specific Performance Strengths
in our students.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holistically, the JS
Curriculum Experience comprising Subject Learning and Student Development
Experiences nurtures Character Strengths in our students, where Character
Strengths refer to the JS BRIGHT Values and JS Learning Dispositions.</p>

Subject learning follows the JS Cycle of Learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For each subject,
the school is guided by the MOE Subject Syllabus to formulate the Scheme
of Work. The school takes into consideration the national directions such
as the development of 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies (21CC), the use
of educational technology (EdTech) and the nurturing of character and citizenship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each subject has clear
Learning Outcomes which are specific to the subject topics. These are communicated
on an ongoing basis to students. There are also Learning Outcomes which
are highly related to 21CC development and these are set out specially
in the school’s I Love Learning Progress Report (ILLPR).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning Experiences
are designed and implemented to support students in achieving the Learning
Outcomes and becoming successful learners in the subject. These Learning
Experiences are set out in the termly Learning and Development Plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning Checkpoints
provide the platforms for students to demonstrate what they know and are
able to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all subjects at
all P1 to P6 levels, the Triangulation Model shows how evidence of learning
is collected over time during the Learning Experiences. Students demonstrate
what they know and are able to do through their work samples, classroom
conversations and learning behaviours.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the academic subjects
from P3 to P6, the school has a School-Based Assessment Structure that
comprises weighted assessments and examinations where students demonstrate
what they know and are able to do in the academic subjects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning Reports enable
students to have an overview of their progress and performance in the subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning Reports come
regularly in the form of ongoing assignments with teacher feedback, rubrics
and checklists. Peer feedback serves as a Learning Report, offering insights
particularly into creativity, communication and collaboration. Additionally,
self-reflection is a meaningful Learning Report, especially in capturing
the learner voice and growth mindset that enhances personal development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holistic Development
Profile (also known as the Report Book) is issued at the end of Term 2
and at the end of Term 4. It focuses on the assessment of subject-specific
Learning Outcomes as well as Conduct, Learning Dispositions and Student
Leadership Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The I Love Learning
Progress Report (ILLPR) is issued at the end of Term 2 and at the end of
Term 4. The ILLPR which is focuses on Learning Outcomes related to 21CC
Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the
end of the year, the school celebrates the exemplary achievement of the
Learning Outcomes with the JS Subject Awards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Student Development Experiences</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Every Student Development Experience (SDE) develops programme-specific
Performance Strengths in our students. Specifically, the Learning Outcomes
relating to 21CC which are central to the SDE are identified and highlighted
intentionally and explicitly to students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The activities for the SDE are planned and implemented for students to
demonstrate the central competencies in the SDE. [Learning Experiences]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debrief sessions and
reflection activities (self-assessment and peer assessment) engage students
in thinking about and discussing their development of the central competencies.
[Learning Checkpoints]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As students participate
actively in the suite of SDEs, they develop the JS Learning Dispositions
and Student Leadership, which are assessed by their Form Teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A special mention
of an SDE is for Level Signature Events which are from the School-Within-School
Model. There are three stages of development – Lower School, Middle School
and Upper School. Each stage has a learning focus, a developmental spotlight
and a tribal story. Every Level Signature Event is aligned with the learning
focus and the developmental spotlight and tells the tribal story.</p>

<h4><strong>Growing Thriving JingShanites</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the school vision
to develop “Thriving Explorers, Mindful Leaders” and the school culture
to “Learn for Life, Flourish as One”, growing thriving and flourishing
students and ensuring their total wellbeing are an imperative for the school.
To this end, the JS Curriculum Experience strives to foster a way of life
in the school that empower students to have a sense of wellbeing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Thriving JingShanites
Framework is premised on the PERMA+V Model (from the work of Martin Seligman).
This framework has a strong belief that Positive emotions, Engagement,
positive Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment and Vitality contribute
towards total wellbeing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school has developed
constructs that are an integrated part of the school’s total curriculum
experience, so that students experience wellbeing as a way of life. These
constructs such as Gratitude, Mindfulness and Growth Mindset appear across
Subject Learning and SDEs.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Positive Emotions –
Gratitude</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engagement – Creativity
and Mastery</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Positive Relationships
– Diversity</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meaning – Mindfulness
and Do Good, Feel Good</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accomplishment – Growth
Mindset, Goal-Setting and Celebration of Effort</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vitality – Healthy Habits</p>
