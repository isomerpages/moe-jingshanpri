<p>At Jing Shan Primary School, we see our students as painters of their
own canvas. With every choice of colours and stroke of the brush, they
paint their aspirations, pathways and futures. The work of the school and
teachers is to equip the painters with the basic kit of know-how, techniques,
attitudes and&nbsp;materials; the space to try, experiment, imagine and
create; and the stewards to guide, challenge and support the painters.
This analogy of painters and&nbsp;painting serves as the backdrop of the
school’s Total Curriculum Framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hold as constants our&nbsp;School Motto, our&nbsp;School Operating
Principles&nbsp;and the&nbsp;BRIGHT Values. These together provide consistency,
stability and safety&nbsp;for our painters.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The School Motto “United and True, Onward We Strive” gives students and
staff a guiding principle as a team. The school community stands as one,
remains true to its mission and moves forward and becomes stronger together,remains
true to its mission and moves forward and becomes stronger together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The School Operating Principles stand for our day-to-day endeavour to
foster a positive school tone that is rich with care, respect and discipline;
be a&nbsp;safe and health-promoting school; and provide a vibrant and stimulating
environment for learning and growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BRIGHT Values of Bravery, Responsibility, Integrity, Inventiveness,
Gratitude, Humility and Tenacity are the anchor that guides and shapes
the&nbsp;behaviours and actions of students.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our big goal is to have our painters as thriving explorers and mindful
leaders who shape their canvases into masterpieces, as set out in our&nbsp;School
Vision. Our thriving and mindful painters will possess the&nbsp;Learning
Dispositions&nbsp;of Motivation, Appreciation, Resilience and Creativity
that put them in good stead to
<br>paint on.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Our School Vision of ‘Thriving Explorers, Mindful Leaders’ aims to inspire
students to navigate the landscape and chart their own pathways with sensibility
and empathy. Every JingShanite will grow as a motivated learner with a
growth mindset; a creative thinker who adapts to new situations and solves
problems collaboratively; a resilient individual who perseveres to overcome
challenges; and an appreciative person who acts in service of self and
others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Learning Dispositions of Motivation, Appreciation, Resilience and
Creativity are the basis of the Student Outcomes unpacked from the School
Vision. Students develop, apply and demonstrate these positive attitudes
and qualities as they learn and grow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The curriculum experience that we provide is the means to realizing the
School Vision and nurture the Learning Dispositions. Anchored on evidence-based
research in learning and well-being, the school takes on a&nbsp;Strengths-Based
Approach to Curriculum Design&nbsp;of programmes and experiences. It provides
a customized curriculum to meet the needs of learners, achieved through
thoughtful pedagogy which is effective and engaging, and supported by balanced
<br>assessment which seeks always to provide feedback for further learning
and improvement. The curriculum experience is powered by 4&nbsp;Strategic
Areas of Focus&nbsp;which are&nbsp;to Develop Critical and Inventive Thinkers;
Ensure Student Well-Being; Embrace All Learners; Leverage People and Partnerships.
They provide the emphases and the directions to take when planning for
student learning and
<br>development.</p>
<p>In addition to developing a curriculum experience that is coherent and
progressive over 6 years, we ensure that every year of learning and development
for the child constitutes a suite of undertakings that are age and developmentally
appropriate. To this end, we see every student going through three stages
of development at&nbsp;Lower School (Primary 1 and 2), Middle School (Primary
3 and 4) and Upper School (Primary 5 and 6). At each stage, there is a
school based Learning Focus, namely “Grow and Be Present” at Lower School,
“Strive and Be Centred” at Middle School and “Flourish and Be Grateful”
at Upper School. The school-based learning focus steers the design of age-appropriate
and development-appropriate programmes and practices, thus enabling students
to advance and grow steadily in their Learning Dispositions of Motivation,
Appreciation, Resilience and Creativity and take steps towards the School
Vision of “Thriving Explorers, Mindful Leaders”.</p>
<p>We immerse our students in a&nbsp;School Culture&nbsp;that is propelled
by learning (Learn for Life) and anchored by well-being (Flourish as One).
Our students learn and flourish by developing self-awareness and self-management;
nurturing intrapersonal and interpersonal skills that enable them to experience
positive&nbsp;emotions and relationships with others; enhancing their sense
of engagement in learning by participating actively in a variety of activities;
contributing to a&nbsp;caring and respectful community; cultivating a growth
mindset to strive for goals that are both rewarding for themselves as well
as others in the community;&nbsp;and fostering a sense of anchor and affiliation.</p>
<p>At Jing Shan Primary School, we prepare our students for the future and
for their future. If the best way to predict the future is to create it,
our JingShanites&nbsp;are poised to design their own pathways, transform
their canvases into masterpieces, and be Thriving Explorers and Mindful
Leaders always.</p>
