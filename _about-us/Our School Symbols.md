<p>In our school crest, the letters ‘J’ and ‘S’ are the initials of the school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The book represents knowledge and learning, which students achieve through
responsibility, humility and tenacity. The torch symbolises the pathway
lighted up by education, which guides students towards growth and progress
with bravery, inventiveness and gratitude</p>
<p></p>
<p>The colour white signifies unity and strength of character, while blue
is a symbol of truth and integrity. The words ‘Onward We Strive’ remind
students to do their best and build a stronger future together.</p>

<p>Onward we strive
<br>With one heart, one mind, one soul

<br>With one heart, one mind, one soul
<br>For Jing Shan Primary School</p>

<p>We learn to think creatively
<br>Holding fast to integrity
<br>We'll live together as one
