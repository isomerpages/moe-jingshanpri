<p>At <strong>Jing Shan Primary</strong>, we believe that education is most
effective when there is a strong <strong>School-Home Partnership</strong>.
Our Parent Support Group (PSG) plays an integral role in fostering this
partnership to support the holistic development of every student.</p>
<p>The PSG comprises dedicated parent volunteers who actively contribute
their time, skills, and ideas to enrich the school experience. They support
school programmes, learning journeys, festive celebrations, and well-being
initiatives, bringing invaluable care and enthusiasm to our school community.</p>
<p>Through their involvement, PSG members strengthen the <strong>School-Home Partnership</strong> by
building meaningful connections with the school, developing friendships
with fellow parents, and gaining deeper insights into their childrenâ€™s
learning environment. This partnership ensures that students receive consistent
support both in school and at home, helping them grow into confident, caring,
and resilient individuals.</p>
<p>We welcome parents to join our PSG family and journey alongside us in
creating a vibrant and supportive learning community for every child.</p>
