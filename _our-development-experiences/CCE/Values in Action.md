# **Values in Action**

JingShanites engage in meaningful  Values in Action programmes  The programmes weaves aspects of Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationship, Meaning and Accomplishment for students to Do Good towards others as they Feel Good about themselves. Doing Good and Feeling Good serves to ensure that even the youngest members of our school community can begin to understand what it means to flourish as they leverage their strengths, work on being grateful and learn to be present.
