### Programme For Active Learning
  
PAL is an integral part of the Primary 1 and 2 curriculum that nurtures the whole child and broadens their primary school foundation and experience. Our PAL consists of modules in the two broad areas, Sports and Games and Outdoor Education, and Performing Arts and Visual Arts, which are carried out during curriculum time.  
  
The 4 modules offered by the school are **Sports and Games**, **Outdoor Education**, **Visual Arts**, and**Drama**. Each module typically runs over 8 lessons. At the end of the 8-lessons module, Primary 1 and 2 students will then engage in the programme “Play to Learn”, where they engage in meaningful play through a variety of board games.

Collectively, the PAL modules will enhance the total experience of your child by allowing them to discover new interests, learn new skills and develop his or her social and emotional competencies.
