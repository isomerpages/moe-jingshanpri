<p>National Education is part of a holistic education. It aims to develop
national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and
instill in our students, confidence in our nation's future. It also emphasizes
on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore.
<br>
<br>Jing Shan Primary has adopted a two-pronged approach in the cultivation
of national instincts among pupils: First, to develop an awareness of facts,
circumstances and opportunities facing Singapore, so that they will be
able to make decisions for their future with conviction and realism.
<br>
<br>Second, to develop a sense of emotional belonging and commitment to the
community and nation. This approach is amply captured in the phrase "engaging
hearts and mind".</p>
