Road safety is primarily meant for the protection and security of people who use the roads.  It includes everyone from pedestrians to people travelling on two-wheeled or four-wheeled transport.  Road safety awareness has many areas and our P4 students and teachers who embarked on a learning journey to the Road Safety Community Park (RSCP) understood the rules that various road users follow. 

We believe our Primary 4 students will learn valuable road safety tips which they can use daily.  It was one of the many learning journeys that our students were looking forward to annually.

**“Vroom, vroom!”  Learning all about Road Safety, Here we come!**
