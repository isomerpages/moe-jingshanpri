_\*LDs would be consistent across P3 and P4_

  

**Introduction to Science**

Students start learning Science from P3.  The science curriculum seeks to nurture the student as an inquirer.  The science curriculum ignites the spirit of curiosity to enhance engagement in explorations.  The goal is to bring joy to the learning of science and value science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world. 

JS helps students to make connection of Science concepts with real life experiences. At P3, students are exposed to the use of ICT as tools to make students’ thinking visible, guide students to work with peers as learning resources and capture the thought-processes of students as they indulge in purposeful learning in and out of classrooms.

**P3 Swimming Programme (SwimSafer)**  

Swimming is a required learning outcome from the movement education within the PE Syllabus 2014, MOE.  Beyond teaching fundamental movement skills on land, students will also learn movement skills through water so as to open up new possibilities in aquatics.  The water environment offers unique challenges to the students in managing their body in different spatial dimensions, emphasising enjoying during learning and enhancing their water movement competence, without losing focus on water safety.
