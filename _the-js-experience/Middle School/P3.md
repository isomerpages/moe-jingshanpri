**Introduction to Science**

Students start learning Science from P3.  The science curriculum seeks to nurture the student as an inquirer.  The science curriculum ignites the spirit of curiosity to enhance engagement in explorations.  The goal is to bring joy to the learning of science and value science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world. 

JS helps students to make connection of Science concepts with real life experiences. At P3, students are exposed to the use of ICT as tools to make students’ thinking visible, guide students to work with peers as learning resources and capture the thought-processes of students as they indulge in purposeful learning in and out of classrooms.
