# **Physical Education (PE)**

Our PE curriculum is closely aligned to MOE’s PE syllabus. It is based on seven key learning areas - **Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness,** and **Swimming.**  

At the lower school level, our students learn about the fundamental movement and motor skills by incorporating the movement concepts. At Primary 3, our students also participate in the SwimSafer 2.0 Programme. The programme aims to teach swimming proficiency and water survival skills to children in a fun manner to minimize drowning incidents.

At the upper school level, our students learn to apply their skills in more complex games and situations. Through the _spiral_ approach, our students are constantly exposed to a variety of opportunities to develop their skills. By Primary 6, they develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in their performance as they practice and transfer their skills across the learning areas to become competent movers. This enables students to become competent movers by the end of primary level.

Besides the PE curriculum, our students also participate in other PE programmes such as the **P1 to 3 Lower Primary Games, P4 to 6** **Interclass Games**, **P5 Cohort Camp** and **P6 Innovised! Games**.
