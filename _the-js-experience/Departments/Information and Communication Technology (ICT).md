# **Information and Communication Technology (ICT)**

A three-pronged approach in the use of ICT for teaching and learning in JSPS has been adopted to

(i) Develop skills, knowledge and aptitude in our learners

(ii) Build character and citizenship in our learners

(iii) Nurture responsible digital learners through Cyber Wellness Education

This is actualised through the various programmes and activities that cater to learning needs of our digital learners. To deepen learning and engagement in the use of ICT, the school focuses on 3 broad areas: 

(i) **Embrace all learners through customised curriculum**\- Developing students' confidence in the use of ICT through enjoyable learning experiences. Empowering every learner with future-ready learning skills through the use of technology.

(ii) **Develop Critical and Inventive Thinking through thoughtful pedagogy** – Using specific strategies to support students’ learning with technology.

(iii) **Ensure student well-** being through JS Cyber Wellness Education** – Developing students as responsible digital learners; taking  responsibility for their own well-being in cyberspace and advocating positive online behaviours.
