# **English**

Through the teaching and learning of English Language in JSPS we hope to nurture a community of engaged learners who are **Empathetic** 

**Communicators**, **Discerning Readers** and **Creative Inquirers**. To do that we will focus on developing 21st century competencies through the teaching of English Language, paying increased attention to **Multiliteracies**, **Metacognitive skills** and **Exploratory Talk**.
