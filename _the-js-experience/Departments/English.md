# **English**

Through the teaching and learning of English Language in JSPS we hope to nurture a community of engaged learners who are **Empathetic** 

**Communicators**, **Discerning Readers** and **Creative Inquirers**. To do that we will focus on developing 21st century competencies through the teaching of English Language, paying increased attention to **Multiliteracies**, **Metacognitive skills** and **Exploratory Talk**.

### Lessons are supported by the following approaches:

* 6 Traits of Writing
* Inquiry through dialogue
* Differentiation approach
* Shared Book approach (SBA)
* Active Learning with Technology
* Active Reading for Reading Comprehension
* Metacognitive approach in teaching critical and inventive thinking
* Modified Language Experience approach (MLEA) 

### Programmes and Activities

The English Department has adopted the 3S approach - Support, Strengthen and Stretch in customising programmes and activities targeting different groups of students. We believe that proficiency of the English Language is cultivated through rich learning experiences. Our programmes encourage the use of English Language through listening, speaking, reading and writing.
