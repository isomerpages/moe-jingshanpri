# **Mathematics**

**Overview of Mathematics in Jing Shan Primary**

Every JingShanite a Mathematical Problem Solver.

Guided by the Singapore Mathematics Curriculum Framework, lessons in the Jing Shan mathematics classroom is designed to provide learning experiences which would allow for the mastery of mathematical concepts and skills, inculcate positive attitudes towards learning and the development of metacognitive, reasoning and communicative skills which are essential for problem solving. This is in line with the school vision of ‘Thriving Explorers, Mindful Leaders’ which aims to develop unique individuals who are critical thinkers and reflective problem solvers and empathetic leaders who are collaborative, confident and active contributors.

**Mathematics Learning within the classroom**    
Through the use of varied teaching resources such as hands-on manipulative, teachers encourage learning math concepts through exploration which lead to the development of deeper relational understanding. The provision of _authentic learning experiences_ in the classroom and purposefully engineered    tasks develop the proficiency required by the learners in carrying out skills such as visualizing space and use of mathematical tools such as measuring    and reading data on a weighing scale.

**Mathematical processes** are important for solving problems and building knowledge. Therefore, there is increased emphasis on _**reasoning** and **communication**_. Mathematical reasoning refers to the ability to analyse mathematical situations and construct logical arguments so as to apply concepts in different contexts. Communication refers to the ability to use mathematical language to express mathematical ideas and arguments precisely, concisely and logically. Therefore, platforms and opportunities such as the use of open tasks and problem solving are provided in mathematics lessons for students to visibly communicate their mathematical thinking and logical reasoning.

As part of thoughtful pedagogy, math teachers explicitly **teach about** **problem solving**. Polya’s 4 stages of problem solving which is a structuredproblem solving model benefits learners of mathematics. Teaching about problem-solving involves the explicit instructions of the use of a problem-solving model (Leong, et al., 2016) and can be the first step to properly introduce problem-solving process to the students. The use of a problem solving model allows proficient math learners to expand on their solution and explore generalization while providing a structured process to regulate students’ thinking and develop metacognition while solving problems. Every Jingshanite a Resilient Problem Solver! Solving fun and interesting problems as part of daily Math lessons!

**Formative Assessment in the Math Classroom**  

In order to play an active role in their learning, students need to understand where they are, where they are going and how to get there. _Formative assessment strategies_ employed by Math teachers in class allow for students to take greater ownership of their learning in mathematics and to be active learners in the class. A classroom culture that normalizes and celebrates error can invite opportunities for feedback, realize connections and become a by product of active learning. Getting students to first think through the errors they made allows for slips to be sorted out and opportunities are provided to encourage self-corrections and discussions on misconceptions. Use of All Students Response System such as mini whiteboards allow teachers to quickly affirm and also pick out misconceptions for prompt intervention.

**Learning mathematics concepts on Area and Perimeter through hands-on activities to develop spatial awareness.**

There are also many opportunities for students to use ICT tools to explore and understand math concepts through simulations and a variety of representations.

**Tiered programmes** which cater to different segments of the student population allow for _greater customisation towards learning_. Support programme such as LSM and ICAN for low progress students will vary according to the level needs. The focus is on mastery of basic concepts and skills through factual fluency at each level (lower & middle schs) and on process skills such as reasoning for upper school students.
