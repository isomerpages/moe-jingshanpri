# **Science**

In alignment with the school vision, we envision every JingShanite to be a Young Scientist who is passionate about exploring Science as a discipline, anchored in values and capable of leading self and others effectively.

The JS Science learning experiences are designed to provide opportunities to develop values, ethics and attitudes that are essential to the scientific endeavour. We also hope to develop 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies and Scientific Process skills. Emphasis is placed on the application of concepts to real life situations, inculcating a positive learning attitude and the development of reasoning and communication skills, metacognition, and creative problem-solving skills.&nbsp;These learning experiences tap on the students’ curiosity for learning, improving their intrinsic motivation to become independent learners.

  

JSPS adopts&nbsp;<b>Inquiry-based model<sup>1</sup></b> (&lt;-- document needs to be uploaded.) as a thoughtful pedagogical approach in the teaching of Science. This unique approach combines the best practices of the following educational theories to provide an optimal learning environment for JingShanites.

**(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The_&nbsp;_BSCS 5E Instructional Model_**    
This model forms the&nbsp;inquiry&nbsp;framework to guide students towards conceptual change. Our teachers design their science lessons using this model, providing coherence and connections across the different instructional activities.

**(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Making Thinking Visible and Cultures of Thinking_**   
Visible Thinking routines&nbsp;help make students’ thinking visible. These routines guide the students’ thought processes to promote active processing. The Visible Thinking Routines are also used as a formative assessment (FA) strategy, allowing teachers to understand the student’s thought processes. With the insights gleaned, teachers can provide feedback to the students to clarify Science concepts, moving their learning forward. These thinking routines help JingShanites develop a thinking disposition and eventually a thinking culture.

**(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Seamless Learning_**   
This is a “learn anytime, learn anywhere” paradigm where students can continue learning even when they are out of the classroom, and outside of the formal school hours. ICT plays a strong role in facilitating seamless learning by providing collaborative learning. Students can tap on each other as peer resources anytime, anywhere to co-construct knowledge. This reinforces the idea that learning can take place anywhere – the world is their classroom.

### Signature Programmes  

JingShanites go through a wide variety of classroom and out-of-classroom experiences that provides context and brings to life what they learn in Science.

**Within the classroom**

**1\. Investigative Performance Tasks**

Students experience and demonstrate their science inquiry skills and competencies by working on investigative performance tasks with their peers.  
Through analysis of real-world problems, experimentation and data collection, results analysis and communication of findings; students are able to hone their reasoning, decision-making and creativity to hone their skills in creative problem-solving, decision making and investigation to solve real-world problems.

**3\. E-lessons**  

Students are given the opportunity to learn at their own pace through e-lessons. E-Lessons also provide the convenience in which students can access learning content at anytime and anywhere.

These e-lessons take the form of a flipped classroom (blended learning) delivered through ICT platforms that encourages collaboration among learners. With the affordances of ICT, students reap the benefits of peer learning. &nbsp;

**4\. Science Journaling**

Every JingShanite keeps a science journal to record their observations and notes on the topics they are studying. Journaling allows students to recognize the importance of self-exploration, questioning and&nbsp;application of content.&nbsp;Important process skills such as observation and communication are taught through the science journaling process. The journal provides a gauge of every student’s level of comprehension in specific areas, for them to recognize possible gaps in their learning. Teachers use this feedback to bridge learning.
