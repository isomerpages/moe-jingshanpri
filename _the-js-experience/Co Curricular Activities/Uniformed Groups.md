### Girl Guides (Brownies)

![](/images/girlguides.jpg)

The JSPS Brownie experience aims to inculcate in our girls, self-awareness, self-reliance and self-leadership. Our girls are constantly encouraged to pursue and strive for excellence in their areas of interest. In the CCA, the girls are also encouraged to learn new skills and challenged themselves to try new and adventurous endeavors. Our girls often engage in service learning by immersing themselves in values-in-action projects in and outside school. The process of immersion, allow the girls to develop a mindset in wanting to be a responsible citizen who can contribute to the community in a positive way. 

**Objectives**
* To enable pupils to develop their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world.

**Teachers’ In-charge**  
* Ms Ang Geok Pheng (IC)
* Mdm Santhi Nagamuthu
