The JSPS Brownie experience aims to inculcate in our girls, self-awareness, self-reliance and self-leadership. Our girls are constantly encouraged to pursue and strive for excellence in their areas of interest. In the CCA, the girls are also encouraged to learn new skills and challenged themselves to try new and adventurous endeavors. Our girls often engage in service learning by immersing themselves in values-in-action projects in and outside school. The process of immersion, allow the girls to develop a mindset in wanting to be a responsible citizen who can contribute to the community in a positive way. 

**Objectives**
* To enable pupils to develop their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world.

The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society. This is achieved by involving them throughout their formative years in a non-formal educational process using a specific method that makes each individual the principal agent of his or her development as a self-reliant, supportive, responsible and committed person assisting them to establish a value system based upon spiritual, social and personal principles as expressed in the Promise and Law.

**Objectives**

Equipping boys with life skills which will allow them to be prepared for life's challenges.

**Teachers’ In-charge**
