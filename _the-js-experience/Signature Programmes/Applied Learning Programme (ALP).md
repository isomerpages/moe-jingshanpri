**Introduction**

Green Explorers @ JS” is our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) that aims to cultivate students’ awareness, strengthen affiliation and empower action that contributes to a more sustainable future.

The ALP embarks on efforts to nurture the next generation of environmental stewards in our school by spanning the 4Cs in these pillars under the Singapore Green Plan 2030 - City in Nature, Sustainable Living, and Resilient Future. Environmental sustainability is integrated into our curriculum, campus infrastructure, culture and practices, and ongoing partnerships with the community.

Through the Teach, Embed and Live approach, our ALP seeks to combine head knowledge on the circular economy (an economy which seeks to reduce waste, recovers resources, and channels them back into production) with integrated programmes that provide platforms for students to collaborate and foster deep learning and engagement with a variety of environmental challenges.  

ALP at JS is aligned to the school’s vision of “Thriving Explorers, Mindful Leaders” which aims to develop JingShanites with the 21st Century Competencies, to be values-driven Green Explorers, who are knowledgeable, resourceful, and creative problem solvers to address emerging environmental challenges and take mindful actions to reduce their carbon footprints and create a kinder and more sustainable future for all.

**Teach**

Through platforms such as the Morning Express, Assembly talks and Learning Journeys, JingShanites become aware of various local and global environmental issues such as global warming and climate change and learn ways to combat them through the 3Rs, water and energy conservation, just to name a few!

We also have exciting programmes during Assembly like the Young Intertidal Explorer’s Programme where students will learn about the different eco-systems as part of our focus on Sustainability in school. Students get the opportunity to engage in conservation efforts beyond the campus!

What’s upcoming will be even more exciting! Stay tune to our page as we will be having a totally new VR experience as part of oral communication in Mother Tongue. Students will be immersed in a virtual environment like our eco-garden as they learn in their MTL languages on themes such as Sustainability!

Green Corridors in JS

Have you seen our green corridors in our school? The corridors along our classroom blocks are lined with beautiful greenery! These plants are adopted by every class and it is our responsibility to care for them.
