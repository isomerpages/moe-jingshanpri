**An Afternoon @ the Ecogarden**

P6 students are given the opportunity to visit the Science Centre to explore more about aquatic plants and animals which make up the  
pond community. They are taught field techniques to catch a variety of aquatic organisms and observe them using  a microscope. Students are engaged in the joy of learning as they understand relationships between organisms, classifying and  identifying each organism’s role in a food chain and a food web.

**P6 Innovised!**  

P6 Innovised! is an event that is organised for students to be creative.  From conceptualisation to implementation students work together in groups to design and create a game concept using re-cycled materials and PE equipment.  The game has to be something feasible, of minimum cost and enjoyable to play. Winning entries are showcased during recess time for other students to have a go.

**Educational and Career Guidance Modules**

MySkillsFuture for students is a one-stop portal to help students discover more about themselves, explore the  different education and career options and start planning for their future. Students can use the information and tools to find out what they want to do when they grow up, learn about the choices on hand and set goals to work towards their ambitions.

Students are encouraged to explore the Singapore education landscape and understand that there are many education  
options for the next phase of their learning. Students will be able to explore the many options open to them based on  
their interest and strength.

Students are also encouraged to discover the world of work and learn about the different job roles and industries.

**Career Fest @ JS**

Our Primary 6 students attend talks and concurrent workshops during our annual P6 Career Fest organized by the school. Prior to the career fest, students start their journeys of self-discovery to learn about different job roles and industries via MySkillsFuture portal. During the career fest, students interact with different speakers about the job skills, work values required and how the speakers overcome challenges. We have invited soldier, architect, doctor, multimedia educator, police officers, music producer, corporate communications officer, doctor, interior designer, tailor and entrepreneur as  
our speakers. Students look forward to listening and interacting with our aspiring professionals who are ex-students,  
family members of staff and students and even local heroes in our community.
