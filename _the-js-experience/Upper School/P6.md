**An Afternoon @ the Ecogarden**

P6 students are given the opportunity to visit the Science Centre to explore more about aquatic plants and animals which make up the  
pond community. They are taught field techniques to catch a variety of aquatic organisms and observe them using  a microscope. Students are engaged in the joy of learning as they understand relationships between organisms, classifying and  identifying each organism’s role in a food chain and a food web.

**P6 Innovised!**  

P6 Innovised! is an event that is organised for students to be creative.  From conceptualisation to implementation students work together in groups to design and create a game concept using re-cycled materials and PE equipment.  The game has to be something feasible, of minimum cost and enjoyable to play. Winning entries are showcased during recess time for other students to have a go.
