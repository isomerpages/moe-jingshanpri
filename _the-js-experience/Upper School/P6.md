**An Afternoon @ the Ecogarden**

P6 students are given the opportunity to visit the Science Centre to explore more about aquatic plants and animals which make up the  
pond community. They are taught field techniques to catch a variety of aquatic organisms and observe them using  a microscope. Students are engaged in the joy of learning as they understand relationships between organisms, classifying and  identifying each organism’s role in a food chain and a food web.
