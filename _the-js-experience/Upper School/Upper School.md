**Curriculum Experience at Upper School**

At the Upper School, students thrive by being independent and resilient learners, in both academic and  
non-academic domains. Not only are they good stewards of themselves, but they also desire to influence the school  
and community positively.

The Upper School curriculum provides a spectrum of self-directed and collaborative learning experiences for students  
to develop a growth mindset within themselves. Through evidence-based practices in Positive Education, students learn  
to express positive emotions, through the display of showing gratitude to one another. The six years of well-being  
practices foster and strengthen positive relationships with peers, teachers and their parents, allowing students to tap on  
their strengths when faced with challenges. In addition, students flourish by ‘doing good, feeling good and paying forward’  
to impact others and the community positively.
