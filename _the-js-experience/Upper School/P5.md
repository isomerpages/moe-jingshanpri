**P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp**   

P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp is an integral part of the holistic development of our students. Not only does it forge camaraderie and develop resilience through common challenging outdoor experiences, it also provides opportunities for students to put values into action and display their character strengths in relation to the core values of Bravery, Responsibility, Integrity, Inventiveness, Gratitude, Harmony and Tenacity. Students take responsibility and

recognize the impact and consequences of one’s decisions on self and others. On the whole, students enjoy themselves through purposeful activities and learn valuable experiences which cannot be duplicated in a classroom setting.
