**P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp**&nbsp;  

P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp is an integral part of the holistic development of our students. Not only does it forge&nbsp;camaraderie and develop resilience through common challenging outdoor experiences, it&nbsp;also provides&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;for students to put values into action and&nbsp;display&nbsp;their character strengths in relation to the core values of&nbsp;Bravery, Responsibility, Integrity, Inventiveness, Gratitude, Harmony and Tenacity.&nbsp;Students take responsibility and

recognize the impact and consequences of one’s decisions on self and others. On the whole, students enjoy&nbsp;themselves through purposeful activities and learn valuable experiences which cannot be duplicated in a classroom setting.

**Fun @ the DNA Lab**&nbsp;  

Our P5 students attend DNA Lab at the Science Centre to learn about the diversity of cells. They learn about the&nbsp;classification of living things, how to identify&nbsp;the different parts of a compound microscope and know its functions. They&nbsp;are also required to prepare sample slides using simple staining methods so that they are able to view these&nbsp;microorganisms under the microscope.&nbsp;By the end of the lesson, students get to understand the application of using&nbsp;a microscope to identify microorganisms or cells and appreciate their significance on Earth.

The National Education (NE) Show is organised to instill a sense of pride and belonging in our students and to bring across&nbsp;the significance of our National Day&nbsp;as we celebrate the success of our nation. It also aims to develop group spirit&nbsp;among students and their commitment to the community and our nation.&nbsp;Students are in for a treat as they will bemesmerized by the showcase of Singapore’s defence capabilities.

**Educational and Career Guidance Modules**  

MySkillsFuture for students is a one-stop portal to help students discover more about themselves, explore the different education and career options and start planning for their future. Students can use the information and tools to find out what they want to do when they grow up, learn about the choices on hand and set goals to work towards their ambitions. Students are encouraged to explore the Singapore education landscape and understand that there are many education options for the next phase of their learning. Students will be able to explore the many options open to them based on their interest and strength.

**Inter-disciplinary Subjects and National Education Learning Journeys**

One of the best ways to broaden our students’ minds is through exposing them to the world outside the confines of the classrooms. Students learn not only through the classroom but also through experiential learning when they are out of the classrooms together.&nbsp; LJs give them the chance to break out of their academic routine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning can take place anywhere and everywhere.

There are a series of LJs planned for the P5s across various academic subjects and more information will be provided  
nearer to the dates of the respective LJs.
