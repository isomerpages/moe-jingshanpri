**P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp**   

P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp is an integral part of the holistic development of our students. Not only does it forge camaraderie and develop resilience through common challenging outdoor experiences, it also provides opportunities for students to put values into action and display their character strengths in relation to the core values of Bravery, Responsibility, Integrity, Inventiveness, Gratitude, Harmony and Tenacity. Students take responsibility and

recognize the impact and consequences of one’s decisions on self and others. On the whole, students enjoy themselves through purposeful activities and learn valuable experiences which cannot be duplicated in a classroom setting.

**Fun @ the DNA Lab**   

Our P5 students attend DNA Lab at the Science Centre to learn about the diversity of cells. They learn about the classification of living things, how to identify the different parts of a compound microscope and know its functions. They are also required to prepare sample slides using simple staining methods so that they are able to view these microorganisms under the microscope. By the end of the lesson, students get to understand the application of using a microscope to identify microorganisms or cells and appreciate their significance on Earth.
