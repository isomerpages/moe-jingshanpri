**Primary 1 Student Learning Dispositions**

**Form Teacher’s Guidance Period (FTGP)**

FTGP is designed for form teachers and students to enhance bonding as well as the teaching of Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) skills. The lessons are designed for students to acquire skills that help them to:

1\. better understand themselves (Self-Awareness);   
2\. learn ways to manage themselves (Self-Management);    
3\. better understand their friends and people around them (Social Awareness); and     
4\. make appropriate and responsible decisions (Responsible Decision-Making).

In JSPS, FTGP is conducted from 8.30am - 9.00am on Mondays for all levels. At P1, students develop awareness of personal identity and learn to manage their own emotions and behaviours and in turn show respect for themselves and people whom they interact with.  Through meaningfully custom-designed FTGP lessons, students experience and role-play characters of an event, a situation or a problem and they are tasked to explore and discover more about themselves and others.

**Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**

Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an integral part of the Primary 1 and 2 curriculum that nurtures the whole child and broadens their primary school foundation and experience. PAL is carried out during curriculum time and it consists of two broad areas in 4 modules:

1\. Sports and Games and Outdoor Education   
2\. Performing Arts and Visual Arts

In JSPS, FTGP is conducted over 3 periods a week during scheduled PAL periods for Lower School students. At P1, learning through PAL is experiential in nature that encompasses learning in a fun and creative way. PAL in P1 gives students many opportunities to explore and discover new interests, learn new skills, develop social and emotional competencies and character.

**Executive Functioning and Mindfulness Practice @ P1**  

Lower School hopes that students will be nurtured through making use of self-directed strategies to think and act in accordance to values, thoughts, emotions and behaviour. Executive functioning centers on self-regulation in many fronts – cognitive, emotional and behavioural. Executive functions exist during early elementary years in children to make sense of the world and people around them. Through mindfulness practices and executive functioning activities, students' social intelligence and self-regulation is learned and developed through a Teach, Embed and Live approach.  From FTGP sessions to PAL, students recognise their own strengths and are equipped with the abilities and capacities to influence their peers positively.

**Learning Journeys (LJs)**

One of the best ways to broaden our students’ minds is through exposing them to the world outside the confines of the classrooms.  Students learn not only through the classroom but also through experiential learning when they are out of the classrooms together.  LJs give them the chance to break out of their academic routine.  Learning can take place anywhere and everywhere.

There are a series of LJs planned for the P1s across various academic subjects and more information will be provided nearer to the dates of the respective LJs.
