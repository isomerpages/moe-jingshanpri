**Form Teacher’s Guidance Period (FTGP)**

FTGP is designed for form teachers and students to enhance bonding as well as the teaching of Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) skills. The lessons are designed for students to acquire skills that help them to:

1\. better understand themselves (Self-Awareness);   
2\. learn ways to manage themselves (Self-Management);    
3\. better understand their friends and people around them (Social Awareness); and     
4\. make appropriate and responsible decisions (Responsible Decision-Making).

In JSPS, FTGP is conducted from 8.30am - 9.00am on Mondays for all levels. At P1, students develop awareness of personal identity and learn to manage their own emotions and behaviours and in turn show respect for themselves and people whom they interact with.  Through meaningfully custom-designed FTGP lessons, students experience and role-play characters of an event, a situation or a problem and they are tasked to explore and discover more about themselves and others.
