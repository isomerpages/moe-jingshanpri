**Form Teacher’s Guidance Period (FTGP)**

FTGP is designed for form teachers and students to enhance bonding as well as the teaching of Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) skills. The lessons are designed for students to acquire skills that help them to:

1\. better understand themselves (Self-Awareness);   
2\. learn ways to manage themselves (Self-Management);    
3\. better understand their friends and people around them (Social Awareness); and     
4\. make appropriate and responsible decisions (Responsible Decision-Making).

In JSPS, FTGP is conducted from 8.30am - 9.00am on Mondays for all levels. At P1, students develop awareness of personal identity and learn to manage their own emotions and behaviours and in turn show respect for themselves and people whom they interact with.  Through meaningfully custom-designed FTGP lessons, students experience and role-play characters of an event, a situation or a problem and they are tasked to explore and discover more about themselves and others.

**Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**

Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an integral part of the Primary 1 and 2 curriculum that nurtures the whole child and broadens their primary school foundation and experience. PAL is carried out during curriculum time and it consists of two broad areas in 4 modules:

1\. Sports and Games and Outdoor Education

2\. Performing Arts and Visual Arts

In JSPS, FTGP is conducted over 3 periods a week during scheduled PAL periods for Lower School students. At P1, learning through PAL is experiential in nature that encompasses learning in a fun and creative way. PAL in P1 gives students many opportunities to explore and discover new interests, learn new skills, develop social and emotional competencies and character.
