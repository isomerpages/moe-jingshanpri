**Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**

Programme for Active Learning (PAL) continues at P2 to nurture the whole child and broaden his or her primary school foundation and experience.  
PAL is carried out during curriculum time and it consists of two broad areas in 4 modules:

1\. Sports and Games and Outdoor Education

2\. Performing Arts and Visual Arts

In JSPS, PAL is conducted over 3 periods a week during scheduled PAL periods for Lower School students. At P2, activities  
for PAL are differentiated in terms of the skills learnt from the lessons. In other words, learning for PAL is progressive from P1 to P2 in terms of social emotional learning.
