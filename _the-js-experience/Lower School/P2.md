**Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**

Programme for Active Learning (PAL) continues at P2 to nurture the whole child and broaden his or her primary school foundation and experience.  
PAL is carried out during curriculum time and it consists of two broad areas in 4 modules:

1\. Sports and Games and Outdoor Education

2\. Performing Arts and Visual Arts

In JSPS, PAL is conducted over 3 periods a week during scheduled PAL periods for Lower School students. At P2, activities  
for PAL are differentiated in terms of the skills learnt from the lessons. In other words, learning for PAL is progressive from P1 to P2 in terms of social emotional learning.

**Executive Functioning and Mindfulness Practice @ P2**

Lower School hopes that students will be nurtured through making use of self-directed strategies to think and act in  
accordance to values, thoughts, emotions and behaviour. At P2, students not only are aware of their character strengths,  
they must be able to tap on their character strengths to enhance their relationships with their family and friends.  
Students practise compassion and responsibility in their day-to-day activities. Through mindfulness practices and  
executive functioning activities, students' social intelligence and self-regulation is learned and developed. From FTGP  
sessions to PAL, students recognise their own strengths and are equipped with the abilities and capacities to influence  
their peers positively.
