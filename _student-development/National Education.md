<p>Launched in 1997, National Education (NE) aims to provide students with
the knowledge, skills, and values to understand Singapore’s history, realities
and challenges that are unique to the nation while also appreciating the
journey to nationhood and having the confidence in the country’s future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>NE seeks to empower students to make sense of what it means to be an engaged
citizen of the nation - someone who is socially aware, adept at critical
thinking and being informed about local, regional and global issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through NE, students develop a sense of belonging, a sense of reality,
and a sense of hope, which culminates in the will to act. These dispositions
help shape our students into becoming active citizens who share the resolve
to build a Singapore for all with understanding, confidence and optimism.</p>

<h4><strong>NE Commemorative Days</strong></h4>
<p>One key facet of NE in Jing Shan is through the NE Commemorative Days
that are linked to key moments in Singapore’s history.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Total Defence Day (TDD) commemorates the fall of Singapore to the Japanese
in 1942. In commemorating TDD, students reflect on the importance of Total
Defence as Singapore's response to threats and challenges that confront
Singapore. They also reflect on the continuing relevance and importance
of the six pillars of Total Defence - Military Defence, Civil Defence,
Economic Defence, Social Defence, Digital Defence and Psychological Defence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>International Friendship Day (IFD) is dedicated to the understanding of
Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia and
the world beyond. Through IFD, students understand our region and the world,
Singapore’s view of the world; and foster people-to-people international
friendships.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Racial Harmony Day (RHD) marks the anniversary of the 1964 race riots.
Students reflect on and celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society that
is built on a diversity of cultures and the will and effort of everyone
to promote social cohesion in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>National Day is celebrated to mark the nation’s separation from Malaysia
in 1965.&nbsp;</p>
