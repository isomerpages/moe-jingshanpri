<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Sexuality Education in schools is about enabling students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience
as they mature;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members
of the opposite sex; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sexuality Education covers the following dimensions of a personâ€™s sexuality:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Physical: Physical sexual maturation and intimacy, the physiology of sex
and human reproduction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emotional: Sexual attitudes and feelings towards self and others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social: Sexual norms and behaviour and their legal, cultural and societal
implications; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ethical: Values and moral systems related to sexuality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>GOALS OF SEXUALITY EDUCATION</h3>
<p>To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through
the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate&nbsp;<strong>knowledge</strong>&nbsp;on
human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p>
<p>To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships
through the acquisition of&nbsp;<strong>social and emotional skills</strong>&nbsp;of
self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours,
development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication,
problem-solving and decision-making skills; and</p>
<p>To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for
others as sexual beings, premised on the heterosexual married couple forming
a nuclear family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation
of&nbsp;<strong>positive mainstream values and attitudes</strong>&nbsp;about
sexuality.</p>
<h3>Conceptual Framework for Sexuality Education</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/conceptual%20framework.png">
</div>
<p>The model comprises three components:</p>
<p>The&nbsp;child&nbsp;at the centre highlights the child-centric aims of
Sexuality Education. Sexuality Education helps our children love and respect
themselves, build positive relationships with others, and be equipped to
make wise, informed and responsible decisions in sexuality matters. These
aims are anchored on the key values of Love, Respect and Responsibility.</p>

<li>
<p>The&nbsp;themes&nbsp;in the outer ring encapsulate what is essential in
our Sexuality Education curriculum, namely, Human Development, Interpersonal
Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and Culture, Society and
Law. The requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes that show love, respect
and responsibility will undergird each theme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The&nbsp;triangle&nbsp;enfolding the child and themes for Sexuality Education
represents the tripartite relationship between the home, school and community.
For Sexuality Education to be effective, it requires (i) parent-ownership
and quality parent-child communication in the Home; (ii) supportive school
leadership and a team of specially selected and trained teachers in the
School; and (iii) partnerships with relevant expertise from the Community.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>THE GROWING YEARS PROGRAMME</h3>
<p>The GY programme is developmental and spiral in nature, beginning at the
Primary 5 through to the Junior College or Centralised Institute levels.
The programme provides for the developmental needs of students at the different
stages or levels. &nbsp;Themes covered at each stage are revisited and
discussed in a greater depth at the next higher stage.</p>
