<p>CCE (MTL) lessons aim to deepen the learning of moral values through cultural
stories, songs, proverbs, practices unique to each MTL. The lessons also
reinforce the teaching and learning of foundational social-emotional skills.
CCE is taught in the Mother Tongue Languages as it holds a rich source
of knowledge for the transmission of values. This will also increase the
language exposure time for students learning Chinese, Malay or Tamil. The
vocabulary learnt by the students during their MTL lessons at each level
provides a guide in the choice of proverbs and the activities in the journals
for CCE (MTL). The questions and activities designed will help students
relate to the stories, songs, and cultural practices that are set in different
contexts and apply the learning to their lives.</p>

<p>Cultural stories passed down across generations are used in the teaching
of CCE (MTL). For young children, the cultural stories help students to
reflect upon themselves through the lives of the characters and make sense
of different experiences. Cultural stories also present engaging narratives
about people or animals to bring out issues of identity, relationships
and choices. Students would gain a deeper understanding of their cultural
heritage, which comprises the traditions, rituals, crafts, expressions,
knowledge and skills that are practised and passed down across generations.</p>
