<p>At Jing Shan Primary, our <strong>Wonders of Wellbeing @ JS</strong> programme
focuses on nurturing studentsâ€™ <strong>mental wellbeing and character development</strong>.
Through this initiative, students learn to identify their emotions and
understand why recognising feelings such as happiness, anger, sadness,
and fear or anxiety is important. They also explore body signs and physiological
symptoms using tools like the Feelings Thermometer and Feelings Wheel,
equipping them with the language and awareness to express how they feel.</p>

<p>In these lessons, students learn about <strong>healthy mindsets, habits, and skills</strong> to
strengthen their mental wellbeing and build resilience in the face of adversity.
They are taught practical strategies such as the Thoughts, Feelings, Behaviour
(TFB) cycle, deep breathing techniques to cope with negative emotions,
and effective time management skills. These lessons complement the CCE
lessons and other school programmes.</p>

<p>The lessons also equip students with <strong>practical knowledge</strong> on
how to identify signs of distress and mental illness and where to seek
appropriate help through supportive platforms in school and&nbsp; empower
every student to flourish with confidence, compassion, and a strong sense
of wellbeing.</p>
