<p>At Jing Shan Primary School, we believe in nurturing responsible and compassionate
citizens who are actively involved in bettering their communities. Our
Values in Action (VIA) programme, anchored in the CCE 2021 Framework and
the 21st Century Competencies (e21CC), provides students with meaningful
experiences to learn about the needs around them and take action with purpose
and empathy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Learning Through Real-Life Experiences</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our VIA experiences are shaped through meaningful conversations with our
community partners. Through these experiences, they also grow in global
and cross-cultural literacy, learning that every act of care contributes
to a more inclusive and thoughtful world. Reflective discussions and journalling
help them make sense of their actions, anchoring the belief that everyone
can be an active citizen with the will to act.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>VIA Progression in Jing Shan Primary School</u></strong>
</p>
<p>VIA experiences are tailored to be age-appropriate and relevant to the
studentsâ€™ lived experiences. The activities are designed to help students
grow progressively from caring for the familiar community to impacting
the wider community.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>Primary 1 and 2 students start by caring for those close to us, such as the children at MK @ Jing Shan and bus captains in our neighbourhood, showing appreciation through acts of kindness.</em></strong>

<p><strong><u>Everyday Responsibilities</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As part of VIA, students also practise Everyday Responsibilities to show
care for shared spaces and the environment. They engage in Mindful Soji
by keeping their classrooms and common spaces clean. Once a term, during
Morning Express, students will learn about how daily habits and responsibilities
are also about spreading kindness and practising gratitude.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Together, we raise empathetic Jing Shanites who are ready to serve Singapore
and the world.</p>
