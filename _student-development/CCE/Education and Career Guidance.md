<p>At Jing Shan Primary School, we believe that every child is full of potential
and possibilities. Our Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programme aims
to help students discover their interests, develop self-awareness, and
make informed choices for the future. Guided by the Ministry of Education’s
ECG framework, our approach focuses on nurturing purpose, fostering adaptability,
and encouraging a lifelong passion for learning.</p>
<p>ECG at Jing Shan is a journey of self-discovery. It begins in the early
years through classroom discussions and reflection activities, where students
explore their strengths, aspirations, and values. As they grow, they are
introduced to a variety of careers and learning experiences that help them
appreciate the many roles and pathways in society.</p>
<p>A key feature of our ECG efforts is the TIDE programme – Thriving Interest
Driven Exploration. Introduced at the Primary 4 level, TIDE provides students
with opportunities to engage in learning that align with their interests.
More than just classroom lessons, TIDE is designed to be experiential and
student-driven.</p>
<p>Each term, students can participate in signature exploration, specially
designed to deepen engagement and broaden perspectives. To bring learning
to life, students have hands-on experiences, go on learning journeys, take
part in workshops led by industry professionals, and hear from guest speakers
who share real-world insights from their careers. These authentic experiences
help students better understand the working world and spark curiosity about
their future.</p>
<p>This voice-and-choice approach empowers students to take ownership of
their learning and develop key competencies such as critical thinking,
creativity, collaboration, and communication. It also encourages them to
see the connection between what they learn in school and how it can be
applied meaningfully in real life.</p>
<p>To support our upper primary students, we also incorporate the MySkillsFuture
Student Portal, an interactive national platform that helps students explore
their interests, reflect on their strengths, and consider potential future
pathways in a self-directed and age-appropriate manner. P6 students will
also be part of the signature Career Fest where students will engage in
various career modules based on their choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Jing Shan, ECG is a whole-school effort to help students grow into
confident, future-ready individuals. Through meaningful programmes like
TIDE, authentic learning opportunities, and strong alignment with MOE’s
vision, we aim to prepare every student not just for school—but for life.</p>
