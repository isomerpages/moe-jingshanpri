<p>Launched in 1997, National Education (NE) aims to provide students with
the knowledge, skills, and values to understand Singapore’s history, realities
and challenges that are unique to the nation while also appreciating the
journey to nationhood and having the confidence in the country’s future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>NE seeks to empower students to make sense of what it means to be an engaged
citizen of the nation - someone who is socially aware, adept at critical
thinking and being informed about local, regional and global issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through NE, students develop a sense of belonging, a sense of reality,
and a sense of hope, which culminates in the will to act. These dispositions
help shape our students into becoming active citizens who share the resolve
to build a Singapore for all with understanding, confidence and optimism.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>NE Commemorative Days</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The NE Commemorative Days, linked to key moments in Singapore’s history,
are an important part of developing our students holistically as we look
to build key dispositions - a sense of belonging, a sense of reality, a
sense of hope, and the will to act - in growing a stronger Singapore together
as a school and a nation.</p>

<p><strong>Total Defence Day (TDD)</strong> commemorates the fall of Singapore
to the Japanese in 1942. In commemorating TDD, students reflect on the
importance of Total Defence as Singapore's response to threats and challenges
that confront Singapore. They also reflect on the continuing relevance
and importance of the six pillars of Total Defence - Military Defence,
Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence, Digital Defence and Psychological
Defence.</p>

<p><strong>International Friendship Day (IFD)</strong> is dedicated to the
understanding of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries in Southeast
Asia and the world beyond. Through IFD, students understand our region

international friendships.</p>

country has made.</p>
