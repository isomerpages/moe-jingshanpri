<p>CCE (FTGP) is a dedicated programme in the school timetable designed to
strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR), build supportive
peer relationships, and develop students’ social-emotional skills.</p>
<p>During CCE (FTGP), Form teachers engage their students through discussions,
activities and reflections on topics related to the six CCE content areas
— Cyber Wellness, Education and Career Guidance, Family Education, Mental
Health, National Education and Sexuality Education. These topics are discussed
in a developmentally appropriate way to help students make wise and responsible
choices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Curriculum time within CCE (FTGP) is also set aside to commemorate our
four NE Days — Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial
Harmony Day and National Day — to help students appreciate our shared national
identity and values.</p>
<p>An important feature of CCE (FTGP) is the 1-to-1 interaction between Form
teachers and students. During these individual conversations, teachers
check in with each student to better understand their well-being, provide
support, and build trust. This personalised interaction plays a key role
in nurturing a strong and positive Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR).</p>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are also conducted as part of CCE (FTGP)
for Primary 5 and 6 students. They learn about developing healthy and respectful
relationships and making informed and responsible decisions on matters
related to sexuality.</p>
