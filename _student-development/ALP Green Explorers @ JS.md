<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>“Green Explorers @ JS” is our school’s <strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong> that
focuses on sustainability through four themes – Conservation, Sustainable
Living, Resilient Future, and Greening Our Home. The signature program
aims to nurture eco-stewards who responsibly use resources and protect
the natural environment through sustainable practices. Anchored in circular
economy knowledge, sustainability concepts, and initiatives are integrated
across subjects, providing platforms to engage students in sense-making
and fostering deep learning to seed actionable change.</p>

</div>
<p>Through the <strong>Teach, Embed, and Live approach</strong>, the Eco-Stewardship
Programme is designed and implemented by building on environmental efforts
through the 4Cs: our curriculum, campus infrastructure, culture, and practices,
along with ongoing partnerships with the community. The four themes of
focus are aligned with the key pillars of the Singapore Green Plan 2030.
Through intentional and purposeful programming, students are motivated
to develop habits, exercise agency, and contribute to a more sustainable
future.</p>
<p>Our signature program is aligned with the school’s vision of developing
“Thriving Explorers, Mindful Leaders” with emerging 21st Century Competencies.
These competencies shape values-driven Green Explorers who can problem-solve
to address emerging environmental challenges, take mindful actions to reduce
their carbon footprints, and contribute to a kinder and more sustainable
future for all.</p>

<p><strong><u>Teach</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Through platforms such as Morning Express and assembly talks, JingShanites
become aware of local and global environmental issues, such as global warming
and climate change. They learn ways to combat these issues through the
3Rs, water and energy conservation, among others!</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Morning Express</em> is the school’s sustainability learning series,
featuring presentations shared on a regular basis during morning assembly.
Our expert teachers and Green Champs share sustainability concepts with
the entire school as part of this initiative. This initiative aims to champion
sustainability practices and foster a stronger sustainability culture within
the school. Some themes prominently covered include ‘Reducing Food Waste,’
‘Food Composting,’ and our ‘Farm-to-Table Initiative,’ supporting the Circular
Economy Approach. Additionally, key environmental events such as World
Water Day and Earth Day are celebrated through this platform.</p>

<p>To celebrate globally recognized environmental days, we organize exciting
programs during <strong>assembly</strong>. We collaborate with partners
such as NParks, Uniqlo, Apeiron Bioenergy, and the Singapore Food Agency
to enhance students' understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues.
Our focus extends beyond awareness to seed actionable change for sustainability,
circular economy practices, and meaningful actions in support of a greener
future.</p>

<p><strong><u>Embed</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Sustainability is extensively integrated across subject learning experiences
and design challenges in signature modules. Student development experiences
for all students and CCA Environmental Science Club members, as well as
student leadership opportunities for Green Champs, enable them to pursue
their interests and exercise agency for sustainability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At our school, integration of sustainability within the subject curriculum
is a cornerstone of our educational approach. This whole-school approach
aims to foster understanding of sustainability concepts across disciplines
and deepen the language of sustainability to influence habits of thought
and action. One example is as such.</p>
<p>As part of the school's efforts to foster student agency and enhance oral
communication in <strong>Mother Tongue Language</strong>, students engage
with Virtual Reality to explore food sustainability within various contexts,
prominently featured in the school's campus infrastructure. Additionally,
the Metaverse is utilized to educate students on water pollution and conservation.</p>

<p><strong><u>Live</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Defined as a social movement where farmers source ingredients from local
farms or grow what they need themselves, the school has its very own <strong>Farm-To-Table Initiative</strong>!
As part of the JS Design Protocol, <strong>Environmental Science Club CCA members</strong> survey
canteen vendors before deciding which vegetables to grow and harvest using
hydroponics. Students cultivate baby bak choy, lettuce, mustard greens,
and kale for the school community to enjoy in a variety of ways. The harvested
vegetables are presented to canteen stall holders to prepare meals for
staff and students. Additionally, vegetables are distributed to teachers
on salad days, guests at events, or taken home to be enjoyed with family
members!</p>

</div>
<p>To cultivate mindful habits, such as minimizing food wastage, purchasing
or ordering only what is needed, and reusing waste materials, both staff
and students practise <strong>food waste recycling</strong>. Food waste
is recycled into compost using strategically placed food composters in
the school canteen and staff pantry. Environmental Science CCA members
offload, weigh, and pack the compost termly. This compost serves as fertilizer
for our plants, contributing to the sustainability of our green corridors.
Additionally, it is regularly distributed to school staff for use in their
home gardens.</p>

<p>Our educational walls, featuring gamification, support <strong>place-based learning</strong> and
explain the intent behind our campus infrastructures—such as the indoor
hydroponics systems and food waste composters. These campus enhancements
increase student engagement through self-directed learning of sustainability
topics, which include the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), food
waste reduction, benefits of food composting, and understanding the carbon
footprint generated from different types of food. At the <strong>Green Explorers @ JS</strong> Learning
Space, students explore through play to understand the environmental issues
faced by different continents worldwide and gain global literacy about
the 17 UN SDGs that continents are working towards to mitigate these issues.
Our <strong>Sprout Spot </strong>allows students to experience the joy of
fresh produce while appreciating Singapore’s efforts to build a more resilient
food future, developing Civic Literacy. Our<strong> Food for Thought </strong>gamification
wall explains food waste recycling and inspires the reduction of carbon
footprint through thoughtful food choices, developing Critical and Adaptive
Thinking. The <strong>Charged for Change</strong> wall highlights energy
conversions, conservation, and renewable energy, inspiring students to
innovate clean solutions while showcasing the school's conservation efforts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Greening @ JS </em></strong>brings our school’s corridors
to life with vibrant greenery. Each class adopts potted plants, fostering
responsibility and care for nature. Plant signages introduced in the campus
gardens deepen students’ knowledge of different plant species. This initiative
is part of the school’s efforts to promote planting habits, build a more
informed campus community, and contribute to a greener environment—aligning
with the ‘City in Nature’ vision in the SG Green Plan.</p>

<p>Our school is actively engaged in <strong>community </strong>outreach through <strong>partnerships </strong>with
various organizations. These collaborations aim to extend the impact of
our initiatives beyond the school premises, fostering positive change and
contributing to the well-being of the broader community. Through these
partnerships, we implement programs and projects that align and advances
our sustainability agenda. As of 2025, some of our esteemed partners include:</p>
<p>• <strong>Apeiron Bioenergy, Used Cooking Oil (UCO) Recycling Programme</strong>:
Our school community collects used cooking oil for recycling into biofuels.</p>
<p>• <strong>Pure Imagination by Janice Wong, Singapore Origin Chocolate Community Project</strong>:
In support of the One Million Trees movement and SG Green Plan for a City
in Nature, Pure Imagination provided six cocoa trees for the school to
plant in the school campus. The school leverages on this partnership to
educate students about sustainable agriculture and the school’s effort
to contribute to build a resilient food future.</p>
<p>• <strong>Uniqlo, The Power of Clothing Schools Programme</strong>: Our
school collaborates with family service centres to collect and redistribute
pre-loved Uniqlo clothing, promoting the circular economy and reducing
waste through the Neighbours Helping Neighbours Programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<strong>Food from the Heart, Clean Plate Campaign</strong>: Every year,
JingShanites participate in the 3-day campaign which aims to raise awareness
about food wastage and encourage JingShanites to pledge and support the
movement. Our Green Champs serve as advocates, encouraging JingShanites
to finish their meals with a clean plate during recess. For every clean
plate, $1 is raised, contributing to feeding those in need.</p>
