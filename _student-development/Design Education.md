<p>Jing Shan (JS) Design Education programme equips students with Emerging
21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies (E21CC) through design, play, and making.
Using the JS Design Protocol, students tackle real-world challenges, prototype
solutions, and iterate designs. The programme integrates structured learning,
open-ended exploration, and supported by a dynamic Makerspace environment,
fosters creativity, collaboration, and independent problem-solving in students.</p>

<h4>JS Design Protocol</h4>
<p>The JS Design Protocol guides the students in a series of steps in the
design and making experience, to nurture them in critical and creative
thinking. Through the experience, students bring about advocacy in the
areas of well-being, community and sustainability.</p>
<p>The JS Design Protocol consists of three stages: <strong>Understand</strong>, <strong>Build </strong>and <strong>Inspire</strong>.
At each stage, students are guided through a series of steps to help them
develop a solution that fulfils a design challenge. Through the Protocol,
we also aspire to inculcate in students the mindset of continual improvement,
hence the cyclic nature of the Protocol.</p>

<h4>“Teach, Embed, Live” Approach</h4>
<p>To create a structured and immersive experience, students are exposed
to the Design Education programme through the "Teach, Embed, Live" approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Teach</strong>: Students learn problem identification, ideation,
and prototyping in Signature Modules. “Signature Modules” are learning
experiences that are designed within existing subjects/programmes, e.g.
PAL and Art. Working together with the subject teachers, the team provides
expertise to infuse design activities into these learning experiences.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embed</strong>: Students apply these skills across CCAs and interdisciplinary
projects, reinforcing their learning.&nbsp; These learning experiences
are enhanced with design and making tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Live</strong>: A culture of design and innovation is nurtured
through recess activities and school-wide events. These activities provide
students the opportunities to practice their design and making skills independently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<h4>JS Makerspace</h4>
<p>To support the programme, the JS Makerspace serves as the heart of student
design engagement. Students participate in recess activities in the Makerspace,
engaging in exploratory and self-directed activities using tools such as
3D pens and LEGO bricks. The Makerspace also curates making tools such
as 3D printers and computer-controlled cutting machines for students to
embark on specialised projects.</p>
