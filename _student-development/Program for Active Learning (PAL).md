<h4>The PAL curriculum offers learning experiences to support students in the development of:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confidence, Curiosity and Collaborative Learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social emotional competencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Values, character and social-emotional well-being&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is an integral part of the Primary 1 and 2 curriculum that nurtures
the whole child and broadens their primary school experience. Our PAL consists
of modules in the 4 broad areas, Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing
Arts (Drama) and Visual Arts, which are carried out during curriculum time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each module typically runs over 4 to 6 lessons, whereby students engage
in collaborative work and meaningful play, allowing them to discover new
interests, learn new skills and develop his or her social and emotional
competencies.</p>
