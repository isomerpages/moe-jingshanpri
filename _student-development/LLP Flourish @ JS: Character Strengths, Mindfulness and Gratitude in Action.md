<h1><strong>Learn For Life Programme (LLP)</strong></h1>
<h3>Flourish @ JS: Character Strengths, Mindfulness and Gratitude in Action</h3>
<p><strong>Flourish @ JS</strong> is Jing Shan Primary School’s Learning for
Life Programme (LLP), designed to celebrate and nurture the character strengths
of our students, developing them into <strong>Thriving Explorers</strong> and <strong>Mindful Leaders</strong>.</p>

<p>Inspired by Martin Seligman’s work in Positive Psychology, our programme
adopts a <strong>Teach, Embed, and Live</strong> approach towards well-being.
Flourish @ JS integrates <strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong> meaningfully
across subject areas, supported by a school-wide structure that encourages
students to show compassion towards themselves, others, and the school
community.</p>
<p>Our programmes are thoughtfully designed to incorporate the elements of <strong>Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment, and Vitality (PERMAV)</strong>. <strong>These elements are seen in our Thriving JingShanite Framework</strong>,
which guides our efforts to develop students holistically.</p>

<p>By weaving PERMAV into their daily experiences, students are empowered
to <strong>Do Good</strong> for others while they <strong>Feel Good</strong> about
themselves. This ensures that even our youngest students begin to understand
what it means to flourish – to leverage their strengths, express gratitude,
maintain vitality, and be fully present.</p>
<p>At the heart of Flourish @ JS is the focus on <strong>Character Strengths</strong>.
Students learn to identify and use their performance strengths and character
strengths to bring out their best selves. By recognising and applying these
strengths in different situations, students build confidence and develop
a positive sense of identity.</p>

<p><strong>Mindfulness</strong> is another key pillar of our programme. Students
are taught simple mindfulness practices to help them stay present, regulate
their emotions, and approach each day with calmness and clarity. Mindfulness
nurtures their ability to focus and respond thoughtfully, fostering resilience
in the face of challenges.</p>
<p>Our programme also emphasises the importance of <strong>Gratitude</strong>.
Students learn to appreciate the people, experiences, and opportunities
around them. Through class reflections, gratitude notes, and VIA projects,
they cultivate a habit of thankfulness, which contributes to their overall
happiness and strengthens their relationships with others.</p>

<p>Through Flourish @ JS, we aim to build the <strong>fundamental learning dispositions and strengths-based mindset</strong> needed
for our students to thrive as confident, caring, and resilient global citizens
of the future.</p>
