<p><strong>A School Within a School – Nurturing Every Child, Every Step of the Way</strong>
</p>
<p>At Jing Shan Primary, we embrace a unique <em>School-Within-a-School</em> model,
thoughtfully and purposefully designed to support the growth and development
of every child. Our students journey through three distinct yet connected
phases — <strong>Lower School</strong>, <strong>Middle School</strong>, and <strong>Upper School</strong> —
each with its own <em>tagline</em>, <em>spotlight</em>, and <em>story,</em>&nbsp;
reflecting the developmental focus of that stage that would guide our students
through their primary school years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This structured approach allows us to create age-appropriate experiences,
nurturing our students' character, confidence, and capabilities at every
level. Signature events are held annually within each school segment, serving
as meaningful milestones in our students’ learning journeys.</p>
<p>A key feature of these events is <em>parental involvement</em> — we believe
that strong school-home partnerships play an essential role in supporting
our children to thrive. Whether it's through hands-on activities, shared
celebrations, or student showcases, parents are invited to be active participants
in their child's education.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Lower School (P1 and P2)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Tagline:</strong>  <em>Grow and Be Present<br></em>In these foundational
years, our focus is on helping students settle into school life, build
routines, and learn to manage themselves. The developmental spotlight is
on <strong>Executive Functioning</strong> — students learn to plan, organise,
regulate emotions, and develop attention control.
<br>They journey through <em>The Story of the Apple Star</em>, which inspires
them to look within and discover the potential that lies at the core of
every learner.</p>
<p>
<br>To support this growth, we invite parents to be part of <strong>Family Active Bonding (FAB) Day</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>Primary 1</strong>, parents and children take part in friendly
telematches, building joy and connection through play.</p>
<p>In <strong>Primary 2</strong>, the focus shifts to <strong>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)</strong> —
parents and children explore selected CCAs together, offering a glimpse
into their child’s emerging interests.</p>
<h3><strong>Middle School (P3 and P4)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Tagline:</strong>  <em>Strive and Be Centred<br></em>As students
grow in independence, they are encouraged to explore who they are and what
they can become. The spotlight here is <strong>Self-Discovery</strong> —
supporting students to uncover their strengths, develop resilience, and
deepen their self-awareness.
<br><em>The Story of the Butterfly</em> guides them through transformation
and growth, much like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly through effort
and change.</p>
<p>The Middle School signature event, <strong>JEDI</strong> (Journey of Exploration,
Discovery, and Insights), sees parent-child pairs embarking on an exciting <strong>Amazing Race</strong> around
the school’s neighbourhood. Guided by the principles of a growth mindset,
they navigate stations that challenge their teamwork, curiosity, and tenacity
— a memorable experience that strengthens family bonds and celebrates the
journey of learning.</p>
<h3><strong>Upper School (P5 and P6)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Tagline:</strong>  <em>Flourish and Be Grateful<br></em>In their
final two years with us, students are prepared to take flight — academically,
socially, and emotionally. The focus is on fostering a <strong>Sense of Belonging</strong>,
strengthening identity, and encouraging appreciation for their journey
and community.
<br>Guided by <em>The Story of the Eaglets</em>, they are inspired to soar
confidently, ready for the next chapter.</p>
<p>Upper School signature events celebrate growth and transitions.</p>
<p>In <strong>Primary 5</strong>, students go on an <strong>Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp</strong>,
building resilience and independence. Parents are invited on the final
day to witness the confidence their children have developed.</p>
<p>In <strong>Primary 6</strong>, our graduating students will embark on a
meaningful graduation trip — a special experience that marks the end of
their primary school journey, encouraging bonding, reflection, and a sense
of closure as they prepare for the next chapter in their education. As
part of ‘JS Celebrates’, families come together for a <strong>heartwarming Graduation Ceremony</strong>,
marking a meaningful milestone as students prepare to step proudly into
their secondary school journey.</p>
