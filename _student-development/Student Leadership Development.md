<h2><strong><em>Every Jingshanite is a Mindful Leader!</em></strong></h2>
<p>At Jing Shan Primary School, our Student Leadership Development framework
is deeply rooted in our School Vision. We champion the cultivation of <strong>Mindful Leaders</strong>,
a concept central to shaping our students into "Thriving Explorers." These
are individuals who not only excel in their academic and artistic journeys
but also embody a heightened awareness and consciousness in their leadership
capacities.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>The JS Learning Dispositions: Guiding Our Leaders</strong></h4>
<p>Our Mindful Leaders are defined by the <strong>JS Learning Dispositions</strong>,
which serve as the core principles guiding their growth and actions:</p>
<h4><strong>★Be Motivated</strong></h4>
<p>They practice a growth mindset, taking on responsibilities with enthusiasm
and inspiring others through positive example. They encourage a "can-do"
attitude, celebrating team achievements and fostering involvement.</p>
<h4><strong>❤Be Appreciative</strong></h4>
<p>They act in service of both self and others, valuing the unique strengths
and contributions of every team member. They cultivate an inclusive and
supportive environment where everyone feels recognised, expressing gratitude
and promoting mutual respect.</p>
<h4><strong>💪Be Resilient</strong></h4>
<p>They demonstrate resilience in the face of challenges, approaching setbacks
with a determined and positive mindset. They exemplify how to bounce back
and learn from experiences, encouraging their peers to stay strong and
persevere, fostering a resilient team spirit.</p>
<h4><strong>💡Be Creative</strong></h4>
<p>They showcase creative thinking to adapt and collaboratively solve problems.
They foster an atmosphere where new ideas are welcomed, and adapt to changes
by finding innovative solutions, inspiring their team to think creatively
in their roles.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h4><strong>SuperPeers: Fostering Peer Support</strong></h4>
<p>A critical aspect of our student leadership is the concept of being a
SuperPeer. This emphasizes the importance of supporting and understanding
peers with profound empathy and respect. Our vision aims to shape students
who not only grow individually but also lead with mindfulness, contribute
positively to their surroundings and communities, and serve as SuperPeers
who uplift and empower those around them, fostering strong peer support
relationships.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Our Initiative: Empowering Every Student</strong></h4>
<p>To ensure every student develops these qualities, all students are assigned
distinct roles for the academic year that intrinsically embody motivation,
appreciation, resilience, and creativity, drawing directly from the JS
Learning Dispositions. This comprehensive initiative includes:</p>
<h4><strong>👤Assigned Roles</strong></h4>
<p>Each student is given a distinct role, fostering a sense of purpose and
responsibility, and contributing to an inclusive school environment.</p>
<h4><strong>📅Year-long Commitment</strong></h4>
<p>These roles extend throughout the entire academic year, ensuring a sustained
and meaningful contribution from each student and building a deeper connection
with their responsibilities.</p>
<h4><strong>🎓Expert Training</strong></h4>
<p>Teacher Representatives from respective departments serve as dedicated
mentors, providing specialised training sessions designed to equip students
with the necessary skills to excel in their assigned leadership roles.</p>
<h4><strong>📈Tailored Contribution Platforms</strong></h4>
<p>Every role is accompanied by designated contribution platforms, carefully
chosen to align with the unique responsibilities of each role. This strategic
approach ensures effective channeling of efforts, maximizing collective
impact and fostering practical application of leadership skills.</p>
