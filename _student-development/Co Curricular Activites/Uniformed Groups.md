<p>The JSPS Brownie experience aims to inculcate in our girls, self-awareness,
self-reliance and self-leadership. Our girls are constantly encouraged
to pursue and strive for excellence in their areas of interest. In the
CCA, the girls are also encouraged to learn new skills and challenge themselves
to try new and adventurous endeavors. Our girls often engage in service
learning by immersing themselves in values-in-action projects in and outside
school. The process of immersion allows the girls to develop a mindset
in wanting to be a responsible citizen who can contribute to the community
in a positive way.</p>
