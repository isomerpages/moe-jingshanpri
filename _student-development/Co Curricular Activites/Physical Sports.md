<p>Badminton aims to develop not only the basic skills of the game but also
character values such as resilience, perseverance and sportsmanship. Through

with a life-long passion for the game. We also hope to inculcate in every
player the importance of teamwork and respect. The CCA is open to all,
and students who show potential and good learning attitude may be selected

<p>The Rope Skipping CCA focuses on refining students’ psychomotor abilities
by developing key physical skills such as balance, coordination, and agility
through engaging and progressive routines. As students challenge themselves
to master various skipping techniques, they also learn the value of discipline,
perseverance, and body awareness. Beyond physical development, the CCA
provides a platform for students to practise mindful sportsmanship—demonstrating
respect, fairness, and a positive attitude during both training and competitions.</p>
