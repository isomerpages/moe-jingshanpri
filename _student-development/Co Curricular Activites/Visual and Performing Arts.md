<p><strong>Art Education at Jing Shan Primary School</strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond building artistic skills, Art Education fosters creativity, emotional
expression, and an appreciation for the world around them. At Jing Shan
Primary School, the Art and Craft CCA provides a supportive and engaging
platform for students to explore, create, and express themselves through
visual arts.</p>
<p>Through the Art and Craft CCA, students are given the opportunity to experiment
with a variety of art materials and techniques. This hands-on learning
experience encourages creative thinking and self-expression while developing
technical skills. The programme also supports each child's emotional, physical,
and intellectual development by allowing them to grow in a nurturing and
imaginative space. Students are guided to appreciate both their own creations
and the works of others, fostering empathy, confidence, and respect for
diverse perspectives.</p>

<p>The JSPS Choir is a vibrant singing community of budding vocalists who
learn, grow, and discover their voices together. We celebrate diversity
and discover the joy in music through exploring a diverse repertoire. Through
practice sessions and performance opportunities, our young musicians are
provided with a platform to develop confidence, teamwork, and a deep appreciation
for the arts.</p>

<p>The JSPS Cultural Dance CCA aims to provide students with experiences
to immerse themselves in the vast world of music and movement in global
cultures, and become confident performers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cultural Dancers at JSPS are encouraged to grow their sense of appreciation
and passion for the cultural dances by learning the nuances of the arts.
They do this through a blended learning experience consisting of face-to-face
and online self-directed dance sessions.</p>
<p>They cultivate the BRIGHT values and demonstrate inventiveness and critical
thinking skills through their execution of the dance movements and teamwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cultural Dancers have been awarded the Certificate of Distinction
at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Performing Arts Presentation and
garnered great support from external organisations during public performances.</p>

<p>Our Modern Dance CCA aims to develop the physical skills and deportment
of our students, as well as to build up their enthusiasm in the performing
arts. We also aim to instill resilience and respect in each member, to
be responsible in every role and action they take and striving for excellence
in all performances. We believe with all these in place, our students will
be better prepared to represent the school in future SYF.</p>
