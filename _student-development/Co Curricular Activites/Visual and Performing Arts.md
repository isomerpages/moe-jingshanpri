<p>The JSPS Cultural Dance CCA aims to provide students with experiences
to immerse themselves in the vast world of music and movement in global
cultures, and become confident performers. Cultural Dancers at JSPS are

BRIGHT values and demonstrate inventiveness and critical thinking skills
through their execution of the dance movements and teamwork. The Cultural
