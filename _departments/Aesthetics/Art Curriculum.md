### Every JingShanite an active artist and informed audience.

The Art Curriculum enables every child to enjoy art, communicate visually and make meaning. It provides a progressive and age-appropriate education for creative and innovative aesthetic self-expression, while developing students’ range of artistic interests and talents.

* Visual inquiry skills to explore their surroundings
* Curiosity, imagination and enjoyment in Art making and discussion
* Confidence in working individually and in groups to create artworks
* Awareness of and respect for histories and cultures of artworks and artists in Singapore and the world
