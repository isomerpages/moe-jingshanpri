Â _My musical experience as I journey through lower, middle and upper school._  
  
The Music Curriculum seeks to empower all students with the knowledge, skills and dispositions to appreciate Music and participate in it. Musical understanding is developed through the integrated domains of Listening, Creating and Performing.

It provides a key platform where every student is provided with Basic Music Education. It aims to:

* Develop awareness and appreciation of music in local and global cultures
* Develop ability for creative expression and communication through Music Making
* Provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in Music
