# **Learning Journeys**

The main objective of these Learning Journeys is for our children to understand what makes Singapore tick, to understand why we are where we are today. They illustrate our vision and planning and reflect our society's character. Our children must learn about them, understand their significance, and think about the part that they themselves can play to ensure that in our journey into the future Singapore continues to stay strong as a nation and to make progress.

Learning Journeys aim to instil in our students, pride in Singapore’s achievements, to help them understand Singapore’s constraints, challenges and opportunities, build their confidence in our future, and nurture a sense of belonging to Singapore.

Inherent in the concept of Learning Journeys is the belief that every trip undertaken by the students out of the school is an important learning experience that will link the theoretical with the experiential - injecting life and meaning to the learning so that it becomes real and concrete. By visiting key installations in Singapore, the students will get see the principles and theories learnt in the classroom and textbooks applied in real life situations, and understand that meritocracy, hard work, the desire to excel, and readiness to take calculated risks have allowed us to overcome many constraints and turn challenges into opportunities.
