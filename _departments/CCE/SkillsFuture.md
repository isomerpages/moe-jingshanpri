# **SkillsFuture**

The MySkillsFuture portal for students is a one-stop ECG portal that empowers our students to embark on a journey of self-discovery and make informed education and career choices. Students may use the information and tools to explore various education and career pathways, and take charge of their future.

This portal is a rich resource for all primary 5 to pre-university students, teachers and ECG counsellors in MOE schools. Parents may navigate the portal with their child, using their child's account and take the opportunity to begin an ECG conversation.
