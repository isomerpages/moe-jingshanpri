# **Sexuality Education**

### INTRODUCTION

Sexuality Education in schools is about enabling students to:

*   understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature;
*   develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex; and
*   make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.

Sexuality Education covers the following dimensions of a person’s sexuality:

*   Physical: Physical sexual maturation and intimacy, the physiology of sex and human reproduction;
*   Emotional: Sexual attitudes and feelings towards self and others;
*   Social: Sexual norms and behaviour and their legal, cultural and societal implications; and
*   Ethical: Values and moral systems related to sexuality.

### GOALS OF SEXUALITY EDUCATION 

To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate **knowledge** on human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;

To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships through the acquisition of **social and emotional skills** of self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and decision-making skills; and

To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual beings, premised on the heterosexual married couple forming a nuclear family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation of **positive mainstream values and attitudes** about sexuality.
