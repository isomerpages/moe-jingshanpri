# **Science Programmes**

JingShanites go through a wide variety of classroom and out-of-classroom experiences that provides context and brings to life what they learn in Science.

**Within the classroom**  

**1\. Investigative Performance Tasks**

Students experience and demonstrate their science inquiry skills and competencies by working on investigative performance tasks with their peers. Through analysis of real-world problems, experimentation and data collection, results analysis and communication of findings; students are able to hone their reasoning, decision-making and creativity to hone their skills in creative problem-solving, decision making and investigation to solve real-world problems.

**3\. E-lessons**  

Students are given the opportunity to learn at their own pace through e-lessons. E-Lessons also provide the convenience in which students can access learning content at anytime and anywhere.

These e-lessons take the form of a flipped classroom (blended learning) delivered through ICT platforms that encourages collaboration among learners. With the affordances of ICT, students reap the benefits of peer learning.  

**4\. Science Journaling**  

Every JingShanite keeps a science journal to record their observations and notes on the topics they are studying. Journaling allows students to recognize the importance of self-exploration, questioning and application of content. Important process skills such as observation and communication are taught through the science journaling process.  The journal provides a gauge of every student’s level of comprehension in specific areas, for them to recognize possible gaps in their learning. Teachers use this feedback to bridge learning. 

  

**Outside the classroom**

**5\. Science Week**

The annual Science Week provides JingShanites with a platform to apply Science to real-world situations, through play-based learning. Throughout the week, students are treated to many engaging demonstrations of the Science concepts in their daily lives. Science Ambassadors, consisting of JingShanites with talents in Science, facilitate these demonstrations. These students are handpicked and trained as Science ambassadors to guide their peers through various Science experiments. 

**6\. Learning Journeys**  

Out-of-classroom learning experiences are important in the learning of Science. The school eco-garden and other green spaces in and around the school allow the students to be exposed to nature and plants. Learning journeys to institutions like Science Centre and the Singapore Zoological Gardens enable students to expand their Science learning capacities through hands-on experiments and authentic learning. 

**7\. Science Challenge**

Science Challenge provides JingShanites with the opportunity to learn Science beyond the classroom in a fun and enjoyable manner. JingShanites actively use their imagination and creativity, whilst applying certain scientific principles when creating a toy that work and has good functionality.

**8\. Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Green Explorers @ JS**

In 2020, Jing Shan embarked on a thematic redesigning of its Applied Learning Programme (ALP). With a strong slant towards STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education, the Jing Shan ALP is designed around the contextual theme of “Sustainability”.

Through the ALP, JingShanites can apply their Science knowledge in novel situations related to environment sustainability, providing opportunities to develop their inventive thinking and entrepreneurial spirit, while boosting their creative thinking abilities. The ALP modules also incorporate design thinking principles. Students use their creativity to develop solutions that are eco-friendly and kind to the environment.
