<p>JingShanites go through a wide variety of classroom and out-of-classroom
experiences that provides context and brings to life what they learn in
Science.</p>
<h2><strong>Within the classroom</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Investigative Performance Tasks</strong></h3>
<p>Students experience and demonstrate their science inquiry skills and competencies
by working on investigative performance tasks with their peers. Through
analysis of real-world problems, experimentation and data collection, results
analysis and communication of findings; students are able to hone their
reasoning, decision-making and creativity to hone their skills in creative
problem-solving, decision making and investigation to solve real-world
problems.</p>
<h3><strong>Technology-enhanced Learning</strong></h3>
<p>Students are given the opportunity to learn at their own pace through
the use of ICT tools. The <a href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Student Learning Space</a> (SLS)
serves as the main portal for students, providing convenience in which
students can access learning content at anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>Our teachers design such lessons using a blended learning approach that
are delivered through SLS and other ICT platforms. Such lessons encourages
collaboration and peer learning among students through the affordances
of ICT tools.</p>
<p>Students are also exposed to the use of dataloggers, as part of developing
skills like data analysis and interpretation.</p>
<h3><strong>Science Journaling</strong></h3>
<p>Every JingShanite keeps a science journal to record their observations
and notes on the topics they are studying. Journaling allows students to
recognize the importance of self-exploration, questioning and&nbsp;application
of content.&nbsp;Important process skills such as observation and communication
are taught through the science journaling process. &nbsp;The journal provides
a gauge of every student’s level of comprehension in specific areas, for
them to recognize possible gaps in their learning. Teachers use this feedback
to bridge learning.</p>
<h2><strong>Outside the classroom</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Science Week</strong></h3>
<p>The annual Science Week provides JingShanites with a platform to apply
Science to real-world situations, through play-based learning. Throughout
the week, students are treated to many engaging demonstrations of the Science
concepts in their daily lives. Science Ambassadors, consisting of JingShanites
with talents in Science, facilitate these demonstrations. These students
are handpicked and trained as Science ambassadors to guide their peers
through various Science experiments.</p>
<h3><strong>Learning Journeys</strong></h3>
<p>Out-of-classroom learning experiences are important in the learning of
Science. The school eco-garden and other green spaces in and around the
school allow the students to be exposed to nature and plants. Learning
journeys to&nbsp;institutions like&nbsp;Science Centre and the Singapore
Zoological Gardens enable students to expand their Science learning capacities
through hands-on experiments and authentic learning.</p>
<h3><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Green Explorers @ JS</strong></h3>
<p>In 2020, Jing Shan embarked on a thematic redesigning of its Applied Learning
Programme (ALP). With a strong slant towards STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics) education, the Jing Shan ALP is designed around
the contextual theme of “Sustainability”.</p>
<p>Through the ALP, JingShanites can apply their Science knowledge in novel
situations related to environment sustainability, providing opportunities
to develop their inventive thinking and entrepreneurial spirit, while boosting
their creative thinking abilities. The ALP modules also incorporate design
thinking principles. Students use their creativity to develop solutions
that are eco-friendly and kind to the environment.</p>
<h3><strong>STEM Playground Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>The STEM Playground Challenges, organised by the Singapore Science Centre,
provides JingShanites with the opportunity to apply what they have learnt
beyond the classroom in a fun and enjoyable manner. JingShanites actively
use their imagination and creativity, whilst applying certain scientific
principles when completing a given challenge.</p>
