<h1><strong>Developing Curious Young Scientists</strong></h1>
<p>In alignment with the school vision, we envision every JingShanite to
be a Young Scientist who is curious and passionate about learning Science;
applies skills and processes in scientific inquiry and demonstrates conceptual
understanding in the application of knowledge to real-life situations;
and shows care and concern for living things and the environment.</p>

<p>The JS Science learning experiences are designed to provide opportunities
to develop values, ethics and attitudes that are essential to the scientific
endeavour, as well as to develop 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies in our
students. Emphasis is placed on the application of concepts to real life
situations, inculcating a positive learning attitude and the development
of reasoning and communication skills, metacognition, and creative problem-solving
skills.&nbsp;These learning experiences tap on the students’ curiosity
for learning, improving their intrinsic motivation to become independent
learners.</p>

<h2>Pedagogical Approach</h2>
<p>JSPS adopts&nbsp;an <strong>Inquiry-based approach </strong>as a thoughtful
pedagogical approach in the teaching of Science that develops the (1) Core
Ideas (2) Skills and Processes, and (3) Ethics and Attitudes domains in
students:</p>
<h3><strong>Core Ideas</strong></h3>
<p>Teachers use the 3C (Capture, Construct, Consolidation) Pedagogical Framework<strong> </strong>to
design their science lessons, providing coherence and connections across
the different instructional activities. This is supplemented with key learning
experiences such as project work and learning journeys that enriches the
learning experience and provide opportunities for students to apply the
knowledge learnt.</p>
<h3><strong>Practices</strong></h3>
<p>Students are provided opportunities for students to develop scientific
practices through activities such as lab work, research work and problem-solving
tasks. Teachers advocate and model the use of approaches such as Claim-Evidence-Reasoning
and Visible Thinking routines to further develop student’s critical thinking
skills.</p>
<h3><strong>Values, Ethics and Attitudes</strong></h3>
<p>In all scientific inquiry, the adoption of certain mental attitudes such
as Curiosity, Creativity, Integrity, Objectivity, Openmindedness, Resilience,
Responsibility and Healthy Scepticism are advocated. Students are given
the opportunity to develop and demonstrate these scientific mental attitudes
in lab work and problem-solving tasks. &nbsp;The value of being responsible
stewards of a sustainable environment is also inculcated through lessons
and daily school experiences.</p>
