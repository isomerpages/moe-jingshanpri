<h1><strong>Developing Curious Young Scienists</strong></h1>
<p>In alignment with the school vision, we envision every JingShanite to
be a Young Scientist who is curious and passionate about learning Science;
applies skills and processes in scientific inquiry and demonstrates conceptual
understanding in the application of knowledge to real-life situations;
and shows care and concern for living things and the environment.</p>

<p>The JS Science learning experiences are designed to provide opportunities
to develop values, ethics and attitudes that are essential to the scientific
endeavour, as well as to develop 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies in our
students. Emphasis is placed on the application of concepts to real life
situations, inculcating a positive learning attitude and the development
of reasoning and communication skills, metacognition, and creative problem-solving
skills.&nbsp;These learning experiences tap on the students’ curiosity
for learning, improving their intrinsic motivation to become independent
learners.</p>
<p>JSPS adopts&nbsp;<strong>Inquiry-based model<sup> </sup></strong>as a
thoughtful pedagogical approach in the teaching of Science. This unique
approach combines the best practices of the following educational theories
to provide an optimal learning environment for JingShanites.</p>
<p><strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>BSCS 5E Instructional Model</em></strong>
<br>This model forms the&nbsp;inquiry&nbsp;framework to guide students towards
conceptual change. Our teachers design their science lessons using this
model, providing coherence and connections across the different instructional
activities.</p>
<p><strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Making Thinking Visible and Cultures of Thinking</em></strong>
<br>Visible Thinking routines&nbsp;help make students’ thinking visible. These
routines guide the students’ thought processes to promote active processing.
The Visible Thinking Routines are also used as a formative assessment (FA)
strategy, allowing teachers to understand the student’s thought processes.
With the insights gleaned, teachers can provide feedback to the students
to clarify Science concepts, moving their learning forward. These thinking
routines help JingShanites develop a thinking disposition and eventually
a thinking culture.</p>
<p><strong>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Seamless Learning</em></strong>
<br>This is a “learn anytime, learn anywhere” paradigm where students can
continue learning even when they are out of the classroom, and outside
of the formal school hours. ICT plays a strong role in facilitating seamless
learning by providing collaborative learning. Students can tap on each
other as peer resources anytime, anywhere to co-construct knowledge. This
reinforces the idea that learning can take place anywhere – the world is
their classroom.</p>

<h3>Signature Programmes</h3>
<p>JingShanites go through a wide variety of classroom and out-of-classroom
experiences that provides context and brings to life what they learn in
Science.</p>
<p><strong>Within the classroom</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Investigative Performance Tasks</strong>
</p>
<p>Students experience and demonstrate their science inquiry skills and competencies
by working on investigative performance tasks with their peers.
<br>Through analysis of real-world problems, experimentation and data collection,
results analysis and communication of findings; students are able to hone
their reasoning, decision-making and creativity to hone their skills in
creative problem-solving, decision making and investigation to solve real-world
problems.</p>

<p><strong>3. E-lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are given the opportunity to learn at their own pace through
e-lessons. E-Lessons also provide the convenience in which students can
access learning content at anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>These e-lessons take the form of a flipped classroom (blended learning)
delivered through ICT platforms that encourages collaboration among learners.
With the affordances of ICT, students reap the benefits of peer learning.
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Science Journaling</strong>
</p>
<p>Every JingShanite keeps a science journal to record their observations
and notes on the topics they are studying. Journaling allows students to
recognize the importance of self-exploration, questioning and&nbsp;application
of content.&nbsp;Important process skills such as observation and communication
are taught through the science journaling process. The journal provides
a gauge of every student’s level of comprehension in specific areas, for
them to recognize possible gaps in their learning. Teachers use this feedback
to bridge learning.</p>

<p><strong>Outside the classroom</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>5. Science Week</strong>
</p>
<p>The annual Science Week provides JingShanites with a platform to apply
Science to real-world situations, through play-based learning. Throughout
the week, students are treated to many engaging demonstrations of the Science
concepts in their daily lives. Science Ambassadors, consisting of JingShanites
with talents in Science, facilitate these demonstrations. These students
are handpicked and trained as Science ambassadors to guide their peers
through various Science experiments.</p>

<p><strong>6. Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>Out-of-classroom learning experiences are important in the learning of
Science. The school eco-garden and other green spaces in and around the
school allow the students to be exposed to nature and plants. Learning
journeys to&nbsp;institutions like&nbsp;Science Centre and the Singapore
Zoological Gardens enable students to expand their Science learning capacities
through hands-on experiments and authentic learning.</p>

<p><strong>7. Science Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p>Science Challenge provides JingShanites with the opportunity to learn
Science beyond the classroom in a fun and enjoyable manner. JingShanites
actively use their imagination and creativity, whilst applying certain
scientific principles when creating a toy that work and has good functionality.</p>
