<h1><strong>Science Ecogarden</strong></h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Science Ecogarden, nestled within the classroom block (Block C) of
our school, is a vibrant oasis of greenery and life. Situated near the
Ang Mo Kio Garden East, it enjoys frequent visits from a variety of animals,
contributing to the flourishing ecosystem within.</p>
<p>Beyond its role in enhancing the school's aesthetics, the Ecogarden serves
as an invaluable outdoor classroom. It provides students with a unique
opportunity to engage with and appreciate the rich diversity of plants
and animals. To facilitate learning, informative placards printed with
QR codes are strategically placed throughout the garden. These QR codes
enable students to embark on self-directed learning journeys, empowering
them to delve deeper into the fascinating world of flora. By simply scanning
the QR codes with their mobile devices, students can access a wealth of
information about the plants, courtesy of the Nparks website.</p>
<p>Our selection of plants has been meticulously curated to expose students
to a wide spectrum of botanical wonders, each with its own distinctive
characteristics. From aquatic plants to medicinal herbs, climbers to flowering
marvels, the Ecogarden boasts a diverse ensemble of plant life. This carefully
crafted ecosystem provides opportunities for students to observe the intricate
interactions between flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Overall, the Science Ecogarden stands as a testament to our commitment
to environmental education and experiential learning. It invites students
to explore, discover, and connect with the natural world in a dynamic and
interactive setting.</p>
