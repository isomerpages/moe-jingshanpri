# **Jing Shan's History**

### THE BEGINNING

The story of Jing Shan Primary School began in 1945, when it was established as a Chinese-medium school in Cheng Sua Lai. It was founded by local Chinese businessmen and members of the rural community here to provide education to children living in this area. Named Cheng San School at ﬁrst, it was later called Chin San School, which means “Tranquil Hill” instead of the original “Green Hill”. The school was located at the present-day Serangoon Gardens Estate before moving to 502 Cheng San Road when the land was acquired in the 1950s to develop the estate.

The students were mostly from farming families who lived in the kampung and they communicated mostly in Chinese dialects.  Many of them had to walk for half an hour or more to reach the school. Facilities were basic then and half of the walls were constructed with bricks while the other half was built from zinc plates. As the building was small, the school was divided into two sessions. The same levels were split so that students could choose to attend their classes either in the morning or afternoon.
### The Kampong Spirit

Chin San School had been re-located to the present Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. Prior to urbanization, before the setting up of Ang Mo Kio New Town, a huge rubber plantation occupied this area. Many rubber tappers and labourers supplemented their livelihood with pig and poultry farming or vegetable gardening. 
  
Though life in the _kampong_ (Malay for “village”) was not as comfortable as life in the city today, those who had been through the kampong era would agree that they enjoyed growing up in the kampong. Life might have been difficult, but the spirit of the community was strong.   
  
When Singapore gained independence in 1965, the key problem which the government faced was the high unemployment rate. In order to solve this problem, the country had to move towards rapid industrialization. Multi-national corporations were invited to set up factories in Singapore. Singaporeans were encouraged to pick up new skills to ensure sustainable growth and development for the country. There was also an emphasis on the learning and speaking of the English language to facilitate good communication with the outside world and also within multi-racial Singapore itself.

Over time, more and more Chinese families enrolled their children in English-medium schools. This was to give the children an edge when they progressed to higher education or when they entered the workforce.

### Growth of Ang Mo Kio New Town, Our Home

##### 1975 to 1984

Development of the present Ang Mo Kio New Town began in 1973, and it was the seventh new town to be built in Singapore. In the 1970s, many new flats sprung up in this new town. The development of Ang Mo Kio New Town led to higher population density in the area. Many schools in Ang Mo Kio functioned at full capacity, and Jing Shan Primary School was one of them.

Two important educational policies in this decade made their impact on Jing Shan Primary School. In 1979, Singapore’s education system adopted the bilingual policy. Every child in Singapore would have to learn English as the First Language and Mother Tongue as the Second Language.

In 1982, the school was handed over to the government as the school board did not have sufficient resources to upgrade the school to meet the standard Primary School criteria set by the government. It was during this period that Chin San School became a full government school. With the handing over of the school, the dialect name “Chin San School” was dropped. The hanyu pinyin version based on the Chinese name of the school was used and “Jing Shan Primary School” (静山小学) became the official name of the school in 1982.
