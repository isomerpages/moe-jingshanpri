# **Jing Shan's History**

### THE BEGINNING

The story of Jing Shan Primary School began in 1945, when it was established as a Chinese-medium school in Cheng Sua Lai. It was founded by local Chinese businessmen and members of the rural community here to provide education to children living in this area. Named Cheng San School at ﬁrst, it was later called Chin San School, which means “Tranquil Hill” instead of the original “Green Hill”. The school was located at the present-day Serangoon Gardens Estate before moving to 502 Cheng San Road when the land was acquired in the 1950s to develop the estate.

The students were mostly from farming families who lived in the kampung and they communicated mostly in Chinese dialects.  Many of them had to walk for half an hour or more to reach the school. Facilities were basic then and half of the walls were constructed with bricks while the other half was built from zinc plates. As the building was small, the school was divided into two sessions. The same levels were split so that students could choose to attend their classes either in the morning or afternoon.
