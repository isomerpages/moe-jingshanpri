# **Jing Shan's History**

### THE BEGINNING

The story of Jing Shan Primary School began in 1945, when it was established as a Chinese-medium school in Cheng Sua Lai. It was founded by local Chinese businessmen and members of the rural community here to provide education to children living in this area. Named Cheng San School at ﬁrst, it was later called Chin San School, which means “Tranquil Hill” instead of the original “Green Hill”. The school was located at the present-day Serangoon Gardens Estate before moving to 502 Cheng San Road when the land was acquired in the 1950s to develop the estate.

The students were mostly from farming families who lived in the kampung and they communicated mostly in Chinese dialects.  Many of them had to walk for half an hour or more to reach the school. Facilities were basic then and half of the walls were constructed with bricks while the other half was built from zinc plates. As the building was small, the school was divided into two sessions. The same levels were split so that students could choose to attend their classes either in the morning or afternoon.
### The Kampong Spirit

##### 1965 to 1974

Chin San School had been re-located to the present Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. Prior to urbanization, before the setting up of Ang Mo Kio New Town, a huge rubber plantation occupied this area. Many rubber tappers and labourers supplemented their livelihood with pig and poultry farming or vegetable gardening.

Though life in the _kampong_ (Malay for “village”) was not as comfortable as life in the city today, those who had been through the kampong era would agree that they enjoyed growing up in the kampong. Life might have been difficult, but the spirit of the community was strong.   
  
When Singapore gained independence in 1965, the key problem which the government faced was the high unemployment rate. In order to solve this problem, the country had to move towards rapid industrialization. Multi-national corporations were invited to set up factories in Singapore. Singaporeans were encouraged to pick up new skills to ensure sustainable growth and development for the country. There was also an emphasis on the learning and speaking of the English language to facilitate good communication with the outside world and also within multi-racial Singapore itself.

Over time, more and more Chinese families enrolled their children in English-medium schools. This was to give the children an edge when they progressed to higher education or when they entered the workforce.
