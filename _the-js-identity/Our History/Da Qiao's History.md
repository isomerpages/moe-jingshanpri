# **Da Qiao's History**

### The Roots

Da Qiao Primary School was officially opened on 11 January 1936 at North Bridge Road. It was a Chinese-medium public school that served the education needs of the community and provided education opportunities for children from the low income families. It was known as Tai Keou School (公立大侨学校) then. ‘大’ refers to ‘Dabu’, the province where the founder came from, and ‘侨’ refers to the Chinese immigrants in Singapore at that time. The founder Mr. Qiu Lin Rong (丘林容先生) also served as the Principal of the school at that time.   To better support the functioning of the school, members of the Char Yong (Dabu) Association came aboard to serve as the school’s Board of Directors in 1939. Mr. Yuan Ping (袁萍先生) was appointed the new Principal of the school after Mr Qiu Lin Rong (丘林容先生) left. In the same year, the school shifted to Lim Tua Tow Road at Hougang (后港五条石). In 1940, Mr. Liu Jun Jie (刘俊皆先生) took over the Principalship of Da Qiao Primary School.   The school was closed down during the Japanese Occupation. After the Japanese Occupation, Mr Liu Jun Jie re-opened the school at Lorong Tai Seng (大成巷) in 1947. It re-located to Jalan Paya in 1964 and functioned there until the end of 1980.
