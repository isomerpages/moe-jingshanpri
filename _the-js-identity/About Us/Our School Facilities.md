# **Our School Facilities**

The current premises of Jing Shan Primary School was rebuilt and officially opened in 2003 under Ministry of Education's PRIME (Programme for Rebuilding and IMproving Existing Schools). The school constantly goes through upgrades to meet the evolving needs of our pupils.  
  
The school consists of four main blocks (A, B ,C and our Indoor Sports Hall). **Block A** houses the school canteen, multi-purpose hall, school library and the foyer. **Block B** consists of the General Office, administrative and staff rooms and special purpose rooms. **Block C** consists of the main bulk of the classrooms, learning labs as well as the after-school care centre. **Our Indoor Sports Hall** was completed in 2021.  
  
The school is also equipped with outdoor sports facilities such as a netball court, a basketball court, a playground and a grass field.
