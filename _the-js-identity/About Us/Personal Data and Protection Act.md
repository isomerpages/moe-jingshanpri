### Regarding Use of Photographs and Videos

Photograph(s) or video image(s) of you and your child may be captured during school events, programmes and related activities.   
  
The school may use and publish such photographs and/or recordings in school publications, website, social media accounts and other official school communication channels.  
  
CCTVs in and around our school premises are also in operation in the interests of safety and security.

If you choose to make an application or send us an e-mail for which you provide us with personally identifiable data, no personal data will be shared without your consent or with other entities, except where such entities have been authorised to carry out specific Government services.  
  
To safeguard your personal data, all electronic storage and transmission of personal data are secured with appropriate security technologies.
