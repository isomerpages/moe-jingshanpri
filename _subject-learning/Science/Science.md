<h1>Developing Curious Young Scientists</h1>
<p>In alignment with the school vision, we envision every JingShanite to
be a Young Scientist who is curious and passionate about learning Science;
applies skills and processes in scientific inquiry and demonstrates conceptual
understanding in the application of knowledge to real-life situations;
and shows care and concern for living things and the environment.</p>

<p>The JS Science curriculum is designed to provide opportunities for our
students to acquire scientific knowledge, develop scientific practices,
and to instil values, ethics and attitudes that are essential to the scientific
endeavour in our students. Emphasis is placed on the application of concepts
to real life situations, inculcating a positive learning attitude and the
development of <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">21st Century Competencies</a> (21CC)
such as Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking, and Communication, Collaboration
and Information Skills.&nbsp;These learning experiences tap on the students’
curiosity for learning, improving their intrinsic motivation to become
independent learners.</p>

<h4>Pedagogical Approach</h4>
<p>JSPS adopts&nbsp;an <strong>Inquiry-based approach </strong>as a thoughtful
pedagogical approach in the teaching of Science that develops the (1) Core
Ideas (2) Practices, and (3) Values, Ethics and Attitudes domains in students:</p>
<h4>Core Ideas</h4>
<p>Teachers use the 3C (Capture, Construct, Consolidation) pedagogical framework<strong> </strong>to
design their science lessons, providing coherence and connections across
the different instructional activities. This is supplemented with key learning
experiences such as project work and learning journeys that enriches the
learning experience and provide opportunities for students to apply the
knowledge learnt.</p>
<h4>Ways of Thinking and Doing: Practices</h4>
<p>Students are provided opportunities for students to develop scientific
practices through activities such as lab work, research work and problem-solving
tasks. Teachers advocate and model the use of approaches such as Claim-Evidence-Reasoning
and Visible Thinking routines to further develop student’s critical thinking
skills.</p>
<h4>Values, Ethics and Attitudes</h4>
<p>In all scientific inquiry, the adoption of certain mental attitudes such
as Curiosity, Creativity, Integrity, Objectivity, Openmindedness, Resilience,
Responsibility and Healthy Scepticism are advocated. Students are given
the opportunity to develop and demonstrate these scientific mental attitudes
in lab work and problem-solving tasks. &nbsp;The value of being responsible
stewards of a sustainable environment is also inculcated through lessons
and daily school experiences.</p>

<h3>Signature Programmes for Science Learning</h3>

</div>
<p>JingShanites go through a wide variety of classroom and out-of-classroom
experiences that provides context and brings to life what they learn in
Science.</p>
<h4>Within the classroom</h4>
<h4><sub>Investigative Performance Tasks</sub></h4>
<p>Students experience and demonstrate their science inquiry skills and competencies
by working on investigative performance tasks with their peers. Through
analysis of real-world problems, experimentation and data collection, results
analysis and communication of findings; students are able to hone their
reasoning, decision-making and creativity to hone their skills in creative
problem-solving, decision making and investigation to solve real-world
problems.</p>
<h4><sub>Technology-enhanced Learning</sub></h4>
<p>Students are given the opportunity to learn at their own pace through
the use of ICT tools. The <a href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Student Learning Space</u></a> (SLS)
serves as the main portal for students, providing convenience in which
students can access learning content at anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>Our teachers design such lessons using a blended learning approach that
are delivered through SLS and other ICT platforms. Such lessons encourages
collaboration and peer learning among students through the affordances
of ICT tools.</p>
<p>Students are also exposed to the use of dataloggers, as part of developing
skills like data analysis and interpretation.</p>
<h4><sub><br>Science Ecogarden</sub></h4>
<p>The Science Ecogarden, nestled within the classroom block (Block C) of
our school, is a vibrant oasis of greenery and life. Situated near the
Ang Mo Kio Town Garden East, it enjoys frequent visits from a variety of
insects and other animals, contributing to the flourishing ecosystem within.
Beyond its role in enhancing the school's aesthetics, the Ecogarden serves
as an invaluable outdoor classroom. It provides students with a unique
opportunity to engage with and appreciate the rich diversity of plants
and animals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To facilitate learning, informative placards printed with QR codes are
strategically placed throughout the garden. These QR codes enable students
to embark on self-directed learning journeys, empowering them to delve
deeper into the fascinating world of flora. By simply scanning the QR codes
with their mobile devices, students can access a wealth of information
about the plants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The selection of plants has been meticulously curated to expose students
to a wide spectrum of botanical wonders, each with its own distinctive
characteristics. From aquatic plants to medicinal herbs, climbers to flowering
marvels, the Ecogarden boasts a diverse ensemble of plant life. This carefully
crafted ecosystem provides opportunities for students to observe the intricate
interactions between flora and fauna.</p>

<h4>Outside the classroom</h4>
<h4><sub>Science Week</sub></h4>
<p>The annual Science Week provides JingShanites with a platform to apply
Science to real-world situations, through play-based learning. Throughout
the week, students are treated to many engaging demonstrations of the Science
concepts in their daily lives. Science Ambassadors, consisting of JingShanites
with talents in Science, facilitate these demonstrations. These students
are handpicked and trained as Science ambassadors to guide their peers
through various Science experiments.</p>

<h4><sub>Learning Journeys</sub></h4>
<p>Out-of-classroom learning experiences are important in the learning of
Science. The school eco-garden and other green spaces in and around the
school allow the students to be exposed to nature and plants. Learning
journeys to institutions like Science Centre and the Singapore Zoological
Gardens enable students to expand their Science learning capacities through
hands-on experiments and authentic learning.</p>

<h4><sub>STEM Playground Challenges</sub></h4>
<p>The STEM Playground Challenges, organised by the Singapore Science Centre,
provides JingShanites with the opportunity to apply what they have learnt
beyond the classroom in a fun and enjoyable manner. JingShanites actively
use their imagination and creativity, whilst applying certain scientific
principles when completing a given challenge.</p>
