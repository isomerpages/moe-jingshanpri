<h4><strong>Every JingShanite is an Empathetic and Confident Communicator!</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) learning at Jing Shan Primary aims to help
students experience the joy of learning and become confident users of their
Mother Tongue. This is in line with the School Vision of ‘Thriving Explorers,
Mindful Leaders’ which aims to inspire students to navigate the education
landscape and chart their own learning pathways with sensibility and empathy.
This is achieved through three curricular goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>developing students’ language competency by equipping them with foundational
language knowledge, skills and strategies to ensure effective communication;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appreciating culture and values by equipping them with essential moral
values and the ability to appreciate their own MTLs, culture and traditions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing 21<sup>st </sup>Century Competencies such as civic, global
and cross-cultural literacy, as well as critical, adaptive and inventive
thinking; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>equipping students with the foundational social-emotional competencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Differentiated Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Differentiated learning is implemented to cater to the different learning
profiles as not everyone learns the same. Within the curriculum, there
is customised learning for those who are more conversant and ready while
bridging support lessons for those who may have limited exposure to the
language. The department uses a range of teaching and learning resources
to cater to different profiles and readiness. Teachers are trained to adopt
and adapt teaching strategies to suit the range of learning profiles.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Leveraging Educational Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>The department actively taps on the affordances of technology to enhance
student engagement in their lessons. Teachers use features from the Student
Learning Space (SLS) to customise and personalise learning resources for
the students. Teachers also use technology to increase motivation by providing
meaningful learning tasks, encouraging students to take ownership of their
learning. Some of the learning tasks include audio and video recording
of oral responses according to a topic and writing activities which require
students to work collaboratively online.</p>
<p></p>

<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Language Signature Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><u>Mother Tongue Fortnight</u>
</p>
<p>Scheduled in Term 3, this annual 2-week programme is conducted during
and after curriculum hours. The programme includes novel and exciting language
activities like games and quizzes, cultural immersions, language exchange
and learning journeys. As students immerse themselves in fun and meaningful
learning, they develop cross-cultural literacy and apply the skills they
have learnt in class while simultaneously appreciating the beauty of the
language.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>MT Read</u>
</p>
<p>The MT Reading Programme aims to instil in students a love for reading
and encourage them to share the joy with their peers. Through the programme,
students develop 21<sup>st </sup>Century Competencies, particularly critical
and creative thinking dispositions and skills through guided activities.
The tasks in this programme are carefully curated to sustain students’
reading interest. The programme allows students to share their insights,
diversify their perspectives and thinking and facilitate collaborative
learning.</p>
<p>Under the MTL initiative, starting with Primary 1 and 2, 30 minutes of
MTL lesson per week will be dedicated to reading and reading-related activities
using the supplementary readers. Through the SOAR initiative, our youngest
Jingshanites will Spark interest, Open minds, Appreciate cultural roots
and Rise as bilingual readers.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>JSPS Creative Writers&nbsp;</u>
</p>
<p>The MT Department is dedicated to nurturing young communicators who can
express themselves confidently and creatively, both in speaking and writing.
The JSPS Creative Writers eBooks showcase the creative works of JingShanites
in the three Mother Tongue Languages. These eBooks highlight the development
of creative and inventive thinking among JingShanites, reflecting their
growth as budding confident communicators. Featuring an integrated audio
playback function, the platform allows readers to not only view the pages
but also listen to narrated stories, enhancing the reading experience.&nbsp;

for them to stretch their potential. Showcase platforms and programmes

students’ strength and offer them opportunities to shine.</p>
