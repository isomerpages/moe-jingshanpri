<h4><strong><em>Every JingShanite is an Active Citizen!</em></strong></h4>
<p>At Jing Shan Primary School, we believe in developing a JingShanite who
learns to value diversity in society, actively contribute to discussions,
and exhibits curiosity to explore and understand the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aligned to the Singapore Social Studies curriculum, Social Studies lessons
in Jing Shan Primary School ensure students grow in knowledge, develop
skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to
the society and the world in which they live.</p>
<h4>Areas of Focus</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Across the six Primary School levels, Social Studies focuses on the development
of Knowledge, Skills, Values through three broad themes:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Discovering Self and Immediate Environment&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding Singapore in the Past and Present&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciating Singapore, the Region and the World We Live In&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Through Social Studies, students’ civic, global and cross-cultural literacy
are developed, aiming for them to be both locally anchored and globally
confident. Students will learn about Singapore in a wide range of ways.
Building on the foundations of getting to know about themselves and their
place in their communities, students will expand on that understanding
to learn about the larger Singaporean landscape and environment, both past
and present.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Primary One and Two students learn about personal and social identity
as they find out what makes them unique and how their community shapes
their identities. They move on to relate to the places around them and
how despite Singapore being made up of diverse groups of people, we are
united by common experiences and our National Symbols.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This knowledge of places around Singapore helps Primary Three and Four
students understand the nation’s landscape better and how its people play
a key part in protecting their environment, while also adapting to overcome
any challenges faced and meet the needs of society. To better understand
the current Singapore landscape, students are exposed to the heritage of
the people living here and the contributions made by early settlers and
the journey to independence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As students progress further in their Primary school education, they learn
about the nation-building process and its challenges, before focusing on
Singapore’s place in the region of diverse people and features. By Primary
Five and Six, students focus on understanding the concept of legacies from
civilisations still having its place in the world today.</p>
<h4>Authenticity in Learning</h4>
<p>This is done through authentic learning, bridging what they learn in the
classroom to the world around them. Artefacts and videos are used in class
to enrich students’ learning through authentic learning experiences. Social
Studies lessons are also paired with Learning Journeys to allow students
to contextualise their learning experiences with real-world settings.</p>

<h4>Cohort Learning Journeys</h4>
<p></p>
<p>To supplement their learning, a common Student Development Experience
is the Cohort Learning Journeys. Cohort Learning Journeys provide all students
with opportunities to explore their Singaporean identity through the arts,
culture and heritage.</p>
