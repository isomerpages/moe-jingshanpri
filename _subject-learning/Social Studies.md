<h1><strong>Social Studies</strong></h1>
<p></p>
<p>Every JingShanite an Active Citizen - where a JingShanite learns to value
diversity in society, actively contribute to discussions, and exhibits
curiosity to explore and understand the world</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aligned to the Singapore Social Studies curriculum, Social Studies lessons
in Jing Shan aim to help students to grow in knowledge, develop skills
and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to the society
and the world in which they live.</p>
<h4><strong>Clusters of Study</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Across the 6 Primary School levels, Social Studies focuses on the development
of Knowledge, Skills, Values through three broad themes:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Discovering Self and Immediate Environment&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding Singapore in the Past and Present&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciating Singapore, the Region and the World We Live In&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Through Social Studies, students’ civic, global and cross-cultural literacy
are developed, aiming for them to be both locally anchored and globally
confident. Students will learn about Singapore in a wide range of ways.
Building on the foundations of getting to know about themselves and their
place in their communities, students will expand on that understanding
to learn about the larger Singaporean landscape and environment, both past
and present.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the Lower School, students learn about personal and social identity
as they find out what makes them unique and how their community shapes
their identities. They move on to relate to the places around them and
how despite Singapore being made up of diverse groups of people, we are
united by common experiences and our National Symbols.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the Middle School, the knowledge of places around Singapore helps students
understand the nation’s landscape better and how its people play a key
part in protecting their environment, while also adapting to overcome any
challenges faced and meet the needs of society. To better understand the
current Singapore landscape, students are exposed to the heritage of the
people living here and the contributions made by early settlers and the
journey to independence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When students progress to the Upper School, they learn about the nation-building
process and its challenges, before focusing on Singapore’s place in the
region of diverse people and features. By Primary 6, students focus on
understanding the concept of legacies from civilisations still having its
place in the world today.</p>
<h4><strong>Authenticity in Learning</strong></h4>
<p>This is done through authentic learning, bridging what they learn in the
classroom to the world around them. Artefacts and videos are used in class
to enrich students’ learning through authentic learning experiences. Social
Studies lessons are also paired with Learning Journeys to allow students
to contextualise their learning experiences with real-world settings.</p>
