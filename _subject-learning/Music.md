<h4><strong><em>Every JingShanite is an Expressive Musician!</em></strong></h4>

<p><strong><u>The Primary Music Curriculum</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Music is a core subject. In JS, students from Primary 1 to 4 attend two
periods of music lessons weekly. For Primary 5 and 6, students attend two
periods of music lessons fortnightly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Primary Music curriculum seeks to develop musical understanding through
3 Musical Processes of <strong>Listening</strong>, <strong>Creating </strong>and <strong>Performing</strong> in
both collaborative and individual settings. As illustrated below, the 3
Musical Processes are core to the Music Curriculum Concept and interrelated
and interdependent in practice.</p>

<p><strong><u>The Primary Music Curriculum in JSPS: Music Learning</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In Jingshan Primary, through 6 years of musical learning, students will
discover music of <strong>different cultures and time periods</strong>,
learn <strong>instruments (digital and non-digital)</strong>, alongside <strong>musical concepts and theory</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The spiral progression of a Jingshanites’ learning can be seen in the
illustration below.</p>

<p><strong><u>The Primary Music Curriculum in JSPS: Character Building</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The natural link between music and culture allows students to develop <strong>open-mindedness and a spirit of inclusiveness</strong> as
they explore, learn and compare various types of music from other cultures
and concepts. In turn, this develops an <strong>awareness and appreciation of music and people from local and global cultures.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Critical and inventive thinking</strong> can take place via musical
experiences when students consider multiple perspectives and articulate
reasonings for their musical decisions. Music also allows students to acquire
and practise <strong>communication and collaboration skills </strong>when
they work with each other in ensemble settings.</p>

their graduation.&nbsp;</p>
