<h1><strong>English Language</strong></h1>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Every JingShanite is an Empathetic Communicator, a Discerning Reader and a Creative Inquirer!</strong>
</p>
<p>At JSPS, we are committed to nurturing empowered learners — confident
in their voice and choice, curious in their inquiry, and compassionate
in their interactions — ready to shape the future with courage, creativity,
and conviction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the teaching and learning of English Language in JSPS, we aim
to nurture a community of engaged learners who are Empathetic Communicators,
Discerning Readers and Creative Inquirers. In line with the future of learning,
we focus on equipping our students with 21<sup>st </sup>Century Competencies
(21CC) such as critical and inventive thinking, communication and collaboration
skills.</p>
<p>To realise this vision, our English Language curriculum places emphasis
on developing multiliteracies, metacognitive skills and exploratory talk,
empowering students to navigate and make meaning of diverse texts in an
increasingly digital, globalised world. Leveraging Educational Technology
(EdTech), we enhance learning experiences and develop ICT skills, enabling
students to respectfully engage in authentic, interactive and collaborative
learning environments that extend beyond the classroom. This prepares every
JingShanite to thrive as confident, future-ready learners in a dynamic
and interconnected world.</p>

<h4><strong><sub>The English Department adopts a progressive and inclusive 3S Approach — </sub><em><sub>Support, Strengthen, and Stretch</sub></em><sub> — to customise programmes and activities that cater to the diverse learning needs of our students.</sub></strong></h4>
<p>We believe that true proficiency in the English Language is nurtured through
immersive, meaningful, and varied learning experiences. Guided by this
belief, our programmes are thoughtfully designed to engage students in
the purposeful use of English across all four essential language areas: <strong>listening, speaking, reading, and writing</strong>.</p>
<p>Through this comprehensive approach, we seek to cultivate in our students
a lifelong love for the English Language, while equipping them with the
confidence and skills needed to thrive in an increasingly interconnected
and globalised world.</p>
<p>To achieve this, our lessons are closely aligned to the EL syllabus and
underpinned by a suite of carefully selected, research-informed pedagogical
approaches:</p>
<p></p>
<p>✨ <strong>6 Traits of Writing</strong> — guiding students to craft clear,
expressive, and impactful writing through a focus on ideas, organisation,
voice, word choice, sentence fluency, and conventions.</p>

<p>✨ <strong>Inquiry through Dialogue</strong> — encouraging meaningful conversations
where students question, reflect, and co-construct understanding, fostering
deeper learning through active participation.

<p>✨ <strong>Differentiated Instruction Approach</strong> — recognising the
unique strengths and needs of each learner, we customise instruction to
provide accessible, relevant, and challenging learning experiences for
all. Besides enacting DI approach in the classrooms, the EL department
also<strong> </strong>adopts a progressive and inclusive 3S Approach — <em>Support, Strengthen, and Stretch</em> —
to customise programmes and activities that cater to the diverse learning
needs of our students.</p>

discussion, critical analysis, and text appreciation.</p>

digital platforms to create interactive, collaborative, and immersive learning
environments that extend beyond the classroom walls.
