<h1><strong>Physical Education</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Every Jingshanite is a Joyful Athlete</strong> – one who exemplifies
a love for physical activity and demonstrates excellence in Physical Education.</p>
<p>Our Physical Education (PE) curriculum is closely aligned with the Ministry
of Education (MOE)’s PE syllabus and is anchored in <strong>seven key learning areas</strong>:
<br> <strong>Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness, and Swimming</strong>.</p>
<p></p>

<h4><strong>Lower Primary: Building Strong Foundations</strong></h4>
<p>At the lower primary level, students focus on developing <strong>fundamental movement and motor skills</strong>,
integrating movement concepts to build a strong physical foundation. In <strong>Primary 3</strong>,
students participate in the <strong>SwimSafer 2.0 Programme</strong>, a
national initiative that equips children with swimming proficiency and
essential water survival skills in a fun and engaging way — aimed at reducing
the risk of drowning.</p>

<h4><strong>Upper Primary: Applying and Extending Skills</strong></h4>
<p>As students progress to the upper primary levels, they begin applying
their foundational skills in more <strong>complex games and movement situations</strong>.
Through a <strong>spiral approach</strong>, students engage in progressively
challenging activities that enhance their <strong>efficiency, effectiveness, and versatility</strong>.
By <strong>Primary 6</strong>, students are able to transfer and apply their
skills across different learning areas, becoming <strong>competent and confident movers</strong>,
well-prepared for lifelong physical activity.</p>
