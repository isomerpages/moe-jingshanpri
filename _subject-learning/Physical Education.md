<h3><strong>Every Jingshanite is a Joyful Athlete!</strong></h3>
<p>JSPS Physical Education (PE) curriculum, closely aligns with the Ministry
of Education (MOE)’s PE syllabus is anchored in seven key learning areas:
<br>Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical
Health and Fitness, and Swimming.</p>
<p>The learning areas are scoped specifically to Jingshanites at the various
different levels.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Lower Primary: Building Strong Foundations</strong></h4>
<p>At the lower primary level, students focus on developing <strong>fundamental movement and motor skills</strong>,
integrating movement concepts to build a strong physical foundation. In <strong>Primary 3</strong>,
students participate in the <strong>SwimSafer 2.0 Programme</strong>, a
national initiative that equips children with swimming proficiency and
essential water survival skills in a fun and engaging way — aimed at reducing
the risk of drowning.</p>

<h4><strong>Upper Primary: Applying and Extending Skills</strong></h4>
<p>As students progress to the upper primary levels, they begin applying
their foundational skills in more <strong>complex games and movement situations</strong>.
Through a <strong>spiral approach</strong>, students engage in progressively
challenging activities that enhance their <strong>efficiency, effectiveness, and versatility</strong>.
By <strong>Primary 6</strong>, students are able to transfer and apply their
skills across different learning areas, becoming <strong>competent and confident movers</strong>,
well-prepared for lifelong physical activity.</p>
