<h4><strong>Lower School: Grow &amp; Be Present</strong></h4>
<p>In the Lower School, students focus on developing fundamental movement
and motor skills. These are reinforced through basic movement concepts
that build a strong physical foundation while nurturing body awareness,
coordination, and control in a fun and supportive environment.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Middle School: Strive &amp; Be Centred</strong></h4>
<p>In the Middle School, students continue to build upon the fundamental
movement skills acquired in the lower years, progressing from basic execution
to more refined application in game situations. As their coordination,
control, and spatial awareness improve, students begin to explore a wider
range of sports and games, applying movement concepts such as timing, strategy,
and teamwork. Through structured practice and small-sided games, they move
from simply developing skills to participating in more competitive scenarios,
where they learn to make quick decisions, collaborate effectively, and
demonstrate sportsmanship. This stage lays the groundwork for confident
participation and a deeper understanding of fair play, effort, and resilience
in both individual and team-based activities.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Upper School: Flourish &amp; Be Grateful</strong></h4>
<p>As students progress to the upper primary levels, they begin applying
their foundational movement skills to more complex games and physical challenges.
Through a spiral curriculum, they engage in progressively demanding activities
that enhance their physical efficiency, strategic thinking, and adaptability.
By Primary Six, students are able to transfer and apply their skills across
various learning areas, emerging as confident, competent movers prepared
for a lifetime of physical activity and well-being.</p>
