<h4><strong><em>Every JingShanite is an Imaginative Artist!</em></strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>The Primary Art Curriculum</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Jing Shan Primary School's Primary Art curriculum follows a <strong>See</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>,
and <strong>Appreciate </strong>framework that engages students' minds,
emotions, and hands-on skills. Through this approach, students learn to <strong>observe the world around them, develop their creative voice, and understand art's vital role in society</strong>.
This experience makes art an essential subject that nurtures well-rounded
learners and prepares them to think critically and creatively in all areas
of life.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In addition, the framework is anchored by the <strong>Three Big Ideas in Art. </strong>They
are</p>
<p>1. Art helps us to see in new ways&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Art tells stories about our world&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Art influences how we live</p>
<p>These 3 big ideas encapsulate core concepts that undergird the study and
exploration of art. By focusing on big ideas, teachers help students connect
their art learning to other subjects and real-world concepts. This approach
shows students that art isn't isolated—it's a powerful tool for understanding
and exploring ideas across all areas of learning!</p>
<p><strong><u>The Primary Art Curriculum in JSPS: Art Learning</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In Jingshan Primary, through three years of arts learning, students will
discover various modes of Art forms of <strong>different media and regions</strong>,
learn <strong>art techniques (digital and non-digital)</strong>, alongside <strong>art concepts and theory</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The Primary Art Curriculum in JSPS: Character Building</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Art curriculum supports character building by instilling core values
such as respect, responsibility, and empathy. Collaborative projects teach
pupils to appreciate different perspectives and work constructively with
peers. Reflective discussions help them understand the impact of their
choices, fostering self-awareness and ethical decision-making.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Art-making in our classrooms is more than a technical exercise—it is a
journey of discovery and personal growth. Pupils are encouraged to experiment
confidently with multiple media and techniques, from drawing and painting
to sculpture and digital art. This exploration nurtures adaptability, curiosity,
and perseverance, strengthening their ability to solve problems creatively
and express ideas with clarity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We believe that every child has the potential to be an artist and a thoughtful
citizen. By integrating art appreciation and creation into their daily
learning, we inspire pupils to see beauty in the world around them, connect
with their cultural roots, and develop resilience in facing challenges.</p>
