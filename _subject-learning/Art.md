<h4><strong><em>Every JingShanite is an Imaginative Artist!</em></strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>The Primary Art Curriculum</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Art is a core subject. In JS, students from Primary 1 to 6 attend two
periods of art lessons weekly.</p>
<p>Our Primary Art curriculum follows a <strong>See</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>,
and <strong>Appreciate </strong>framework that engages students' minds,
emotions, and hands-on skills. Through this approach, students learn to <strong>observe the world around them, develop their creative voice, and understand art's vital role in society</strong>.
This experience makes art an essential subject that nurtures well-rounded
learners and prepares them to think critically and creatively in all areas
of life.</p>
