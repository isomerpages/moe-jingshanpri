<h4><strong><em>Every JingShanite a Mathematical Problem Solver!</em></strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Guided by the Singapore Mathematics Curriculum Framework, lessons in the
Jing Shan mathematics classroom is designed to provide learning experiences
which would allow for the mastery of mathematical concepts and skills,
inculcate positive attitudes towards learning and the development of metacognitive,
reasoning and communicative skills which are essential for problem solving.
This is in line with the school vision of ‘Thriving Explorers, Mindful
Leaders’ which aims to develop unique individuals who are critical thinkers
and reflective problem solvers and empathetic leaders who are collaborative,
confident and active contributors.</p>

<p><strong>Mathematics Learning within the classroom</strong>
<br>Through the use of varied teaching resources such as hands-on manipulative,
teachers encourage learning math concepts through exploration which lead&nbsp;to
the development of deeper relational understanding. The provision of&nbsp;<em>authentic learning experiences</em>&nbsp;in
the classroom and purposefully engineered tasks develop the proficiency
required by the learners in carrying out skills such as visualizing space
and use of mathematical tools such as measuring and reading data on a weighing
scale.</p>

<p><strong>Mathematics Learning within the classroom<br></strong>Teachers
use varied resources like hands-on manipulatives to promote exploration
and deepen students’ understanding of math concepts. Authentic tasks and
real-world experiences help students develop skills such as spatial visualization
and using tools like measuring tapes and weighing scales.</p>

<p>Mathematical processes like reasoning and communication are important
for solving problems and building knowledge. Students are given open tasks
and problem-solving opportunities to apply concepts, express ideas clearly
and demonstrate logical thinking using precise mathematical language.</p>

<p><strong>Formative Assessment in the Mathematics Classroom</strong>
</p>
<p>To take on an active role in learning, students need to understand where
they are, where they are going and how to get there. <em>Formative assessment strategies</em> help
them take ownership and engage actively in class. A classroom culture that
values mistakes encourages opportunities for feedback and become a byproduct
of active learning. Tools like All Students Response Systems and ICT-based
simulations support timely intervention and concept exploration through
varied representations.</p>

<p><strong>Developing Positive Learning Attitudes through Alternative Assessment and Differentiated Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>A positive attitude towards mathematics - such as confidence, motivation
and perseverance - contributes to one’s learning disposition and the inclination
towards using mathematics to solve problems.</p>
<p>Alternative assessments like math journalling help students express their
thinking and allow teachers to gain deeper insights into student progress
beyond grades. It also promotes the use of mathematical language to communicate
ideas clearly.</p>
<p>Tiered programmes cater to different student needs, allowing customised
support. Programmes like LSM focus on building foundational fluency in
lower and middle levels while upper levels emphasise process skills such
as reasoning.</p>

<p><strong>Mathematics Coaching Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>With a small teacher-student ratio, weekly one-hour sessions are conducted.</p>

<p>For higher progress students, enrichment is provided through the E2K programme
at P4 and P5 and participation in Mathematics Olympiads for selected students
at the middle and upper levels.</p>

<p><strong>Learning beyond the Mathematics classroom</strong>
</p>
<p>To build resilience, mindfulness and apply math in real-life contexts,
learning extends beyond the classroom. Activities like budgeting and planning
a birthday party help students develop practical skills through authentic,
real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>These experiences involve non-routine, multi-stage tasks that require
students to apply and connect mathematical concepts. They support knowledge
transfer, reinforce learning and build real-world skills like collaboration,
communication and empathy.</p>

<p><strong>Home-based Learning in Action</strong>
</p>
<p>Mathematics learning extends to the home with engaging tasks and activities.
Students use teacher-created videos, everyday items for hands-on learning
and online platforms featuring fun games like escape rooms and quizzes
to reinforce understanding.</p>
