<h1><strong>Mathematics</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Overview of Mathematics in Jing Shan Primary</strong>
</p>
<p>Every JingShanite a Mathematical Problem Solver.</p>
<p>Guided by the Singapore Mathematics Curriculum Framework, lessons in the
Jing Shan mathematics classroom is designed to provide learning experiences
which would allow for the mastery of mathematical concepts and skills,
inculcate positive attitudes towards learning and the development&nbsp;of
metacognitive, reasoning and communicative skills which are essential for
problem solving. This is in line with the school vision of ‘Thriving&nbsp;Explorers,&nbsp;Mindful
Leaders’ which aims to develop unique individuals who are critical thinkers
and reflective problem solvers and empathetic leaders&nbsp;who are collaborative,
confident and active contributors.</p>

<p><strong>Mathematics Learning within the classroom</strong>
<br>Through the use of varied teaching resources such as hands-on manipulative,
teachers encourage learning math concepts through exploration which lead&nbsp;to
the development of deeper relational understanding. The provision of&nbsp;<em>authentic learning experiences</em>&nbsp;in
the classroom and purposefully engineered&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tasks
develop the proficiency required by the learners in carrying out skills
such as visualizing space and use of mathematical tools such as measuring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
reading data on a weighing scale.</p>

<p><strong>Mathematical processes</strong>&nbsp;are important for solving
problems and building knowledge. Therefore, there is increased emphasis
on&nbsp;<strong><em>reasoning</em></strong><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><strong><em>communication</em></strong>.
Mathematical reasoning refers to the ability to analyse mathematical situations
and construct logical arguments so as to apply concepts in different contexts.
Communication refers to the ability to use mathematical language to express
mathematical ideas and arguments precisely, concisely and logically. Therefore,
platforms and opportunities such as the use of open tasks and problem solving
are provided in mathematics lessons for students to visibly communicate
their mathematical thinking and logical reasoning.</p>

<p>As part of thoughtful pedagogy, math teachers explicitly <strong>teach about</strong>  <strong>problem solving</strong>.
Polya’s 4 stages of problem solving which is a structured problem-solving
model benefits learners of mathematics. Teaching about problem-solving
involves the explicit instructions of the use of a problem-solving model
(Leong, et al., 2016) and can be the first step to properly introduce problem-solving
process to the students. The use of a problem-solving model allows proficient
math learners to expand on their solution and explore generalization while
providing a structured process to regulate students’ thinking and develop
metacognition while solving problems. Every Jingshanite a Resilient Problem
Solver! Solving fun and interesting problems as part of daily Math lessons!</p>

<p><strong>Formative Assessment in the Math Classroom</strong>
</p>
<p>In order to play an active role in their learning, students need to understand
where they are, where they are going and how to get there. <em>Formative assessment strategies</em> employed
by Math teachers in class allow students to take greater ownership of their
learning in mathematics and to be active learners in the class. A classroom
culture that normalizes and celebrates errors can invite opportunities
for feedback, realize connections and become a byproduct of active learning.
Getting students to first think through the errors they made allows slips
to be sorted out and opportunities are provided to encourage self-corrections
and discussions on misconceptions. Use of All Students Response System
such as online portals allow teachers to quickly affirm and pick out misconceptions
for prompt intervention. There are also many opportunities for students
to use ICT tools to explore and understand math concepts through simulations
and a variety of representations.</p>

<p><strong>Developing Positive Learning Attitudes through Alternative Assessment and Differentiated Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>A positive attitude towards mathematics contributes to one’s learning
disposition and the inclination towards using math to solve problems. Attitudes
include belief, appreciation, confidence, motivation, interest and perseverance
to solving problems using mathematics.</p>
<p>Alternative assessments such as math journaling with content and process
prompts allow teachers to have a better understanding of their students’
learning and allow them to provide a more holistic report of a student’s
progress in their mathematics learning rather than just a grade. Mathematical
journaling as part of mathematics learning provides platforms for communication
of mathematical ideas and concepts to their teachers and peers. It allows
students to use mathematical language to express mathematical ideas to
make their thinking visible.</p>
<p><strong>Tiered programmes</strong> which cater to different segments of
the student population allow for greater customisation towards learning.
Support programme such as LSM for low progress students will vary according
to the level needs. The focus is on mastery of basic concepts and skills
through factual fluency at each level (lower &amp; middle sch) and on process
skills such as reasoning for upper school students.</p>

<p><strong>Math Coaching Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>With a small teacher-student ratio, weekly one-hour sessions are conducted.</p>

<p>For the higher progress students, mathematical learning at the middle
and upper school will be enriched through the E2K programme at P4 level
for High Progress students. Selected groups of students will also participate
in Math Olympiads.</p>

<p><strong>Learning beyond the Mathematics classroom</strong>
</p>
<p>To leverage students’ mathematical knowledge and skills in an authentic
context and to develop resilience and mindfulness, learning of mathematics
goes beyond the four walls of the classroom. An example of contextualisation
of math activities in the real world which allows students to learn budgeting
and planning for a birthday party. This level activity replicates real-world
situations that would allow for authenticity in the learning of mathematics.</p>

</div>
<p>Such experiences which combine non-routine and multi-stage tasks require
students to apply and combine mathematical concepts and skills learnt in
their math lessons. It not only allows for transference of such knowledge
and skills, it also helps consolidate students’ learning through co construction
of new knowledge and develops real-world skills such as collaboration and
communication. It also develops empathy for others.</p>

<p><strong>Home-based Learning in Action</strong>
</p>
<p>Mathematics learning continues at home through a variety of math tasks
and activities. Besides the use of online learning videos created by the
teachers themselves, students continue to do hands-on learning using items
easily available at home to further engage themselves! Through the use
of different online platforms, mathematical learning is a fun-filled one
with games such as escape rooms and lots of quizzes to assess understanding!</p>
