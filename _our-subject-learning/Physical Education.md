<h1><strong>Physical Education (PE)</strong></h1>
<p>Our PE curriculum is closely aligned to MOE’s PE syllabus. It is based
on seven key learning areas -&nbsp;<strong>Athletics, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Swimming.</strong>
</p>
<p>At the lower school level, our students learn about the fundamental movement
and motor skills by incorporating the movement concepts. At Primary 3,
our students also participate in the SwimSafer 2.0 Programme. The programme
aims to teach swimming proficiency and water survival skills to children
in a fun manner to minimize drowning incidents.</p>
<p>At the upper school level, our students learn to apply their skills in
more complex games and situations. Through the&nbsp;<em>spiral</em>&nbsp;approach,
our students are constantly exposed to a variety of opportunities to develop
their skills. By Primary 6, they develop efficiency, effectiveness and
versatility in their performance as they practice and transfer their skills
across the learning areas to become competent movers. This enables students
to become competent movers by the end of primary level.</p>
<p>Besides the PE curriculum, our students also participate in other PE programmes
such as the&nbsp;<strong>P1 to 3 Ninja Course, P4 to 6</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Interclass Games</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>P5 Cohort Camp</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>P6 Sports Education Programme (SEP)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Education Curriculum Framework (MOE, 2024)</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The purpose of Physical Education is to develop physically competent and
confident individuals who enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living
safely and responsibly.</p>
<p>Broadly, the goals of our PE curriculum (MOE, 2024) are:</p>
<p>Goal 1: Movement Competence. Students are competent and confident to participate
in a range of physical and outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Goal 2: Healthy Lifestyle Practices. Students have a personal commitment
to healthy lifestyle practices in physical activity, nutrition, sleep,
outdoor time and hygiene.</p>
<p>Goal 3: Safety Mindset. Students apply risk assessment to manage daily
and physical activities with respect to self, others and the environment.</p>
<p>Goal 4: Core Values. Students make informed and responsible decisions
with regard to personal behaviour and social interactions based on sound
values-based judgements.</p>
<p>Goal 5: Enjoyment. Students enjoy and value physical activities and healthy
living in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at our students in action!</p>
