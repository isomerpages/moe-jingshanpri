<h1>Developing Curious Young Scientists</h1>
<p>In alignment with the school vision, we envision every JingShanite to
be a Young Scientist who is curious and passionate about learning Science;
applies skills and processes in scientific inquiry and demonstrates conceptual
understanding in the application of knowledge to real-life situations;
and shows care and concern for living things and the environment.</p>

<p>The JS Science curriculum is designed to provide opportunities for our
students to acquire scientific knowledge, develop scientific practices,
and to instil values, ethics and attitudes that are essential to the scientific
endeavour in our students. Emphasis is placed on the application of concepts
to real life situations, inculcating a positive learning attitude and the
development of <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">21st Century Competencies</a> (21CC)
such as Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking, and Communication, Collaboration
and Information Skills.&nbsp;These learning experiences tap on the students’
curiosity for learning, improving their intrinsic motivation to become
independent learners.</p>

<h2>Pedagogical Approach</h2>
<p>JSPS adopts&nbsp;an <strong>Inquiry-based approach </strong>as a thoughtful
pedagogical approach in the teaching of Science that develops the (1) Core
Ideas (2) Practices, and (3) Values, Ethics and Attitudes domains in students:</p>
<h3>Core Ideas</h3>
<p>Teachers use the 3C (Capture, Construct, Consolidation) pedagogical framework<strong> </strong>to
design their science lessons, providing coherence and connections across
the different instructional activities. This is supplemented with key learning
experiences such as project work and learning journeys that enriches the
learning experience and provide opportunities for students to apply the
knowledge learnt.</p>
<h3>Practices</h3>
<p>Students are provided opportunities for students to develop scientific
practices through activities such as lab work, research work and problem-solving
tasks. Teachers advocate and model the use of approaches such as Claim-Evidence-Reasoning
and Visible Thinking routines to further develop student’s critical thinking
skills.</p>
<h3>Values, Ethics and Attitudes</h3>
<p>In all scientific inquiry, the adoption of certain mental attitudes such
as Curiosity, Creativity, Integrity, Objectivity, Openmindedness, Resilience,
Responsibility and Healthy Scepticism are advocated. Students are given
the opportunity to develop and demonstrate these scientific mental attitudes
in lab work and problem-solving tasks. &nbsp;The value of being responsible
stewards of a sustainable environment is also inculcated through lessons
and daily school experiences.</p>
