<h2>An Outdoor Classroom</h2>
<p>Beyond its role in enhancing the school's aesthetics, the Ecogarden serves
as an invaluable outdoor classroom. It provides students with a unique
opportunity to engage with and appreciate the rich diversity of plants
and animals. To facilitate learning, informative placards printed with
QR codes are strategically placed throughout the garden. These QR codes
enable students to embark on self-directed learning journeys, empowering
them to delve deeper into the fascinating world of flora. By simply scanning
the QR codes with their mobile devices, students can access a wealth of
information about the plants.</p>
